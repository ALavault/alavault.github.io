# Simple music Part 2 : Rhythm

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, western-style rhythm.

## 1. Time. It needs time.

A broad definition of *rhythm* can be the organization in time of musical events.

In a more applicable way, when to play pitches.

Rhythm does not exists without a *pulse* : this what a metronome provides and it's the pulse that makes people headbang.

### 1.1 Divide and conquer

By dividing the pulse in subgroup of even size, we can create more interesting rhythm.

*Exercice :* 
- Listen to your favourite song and clap where you feel like it should happen. This is the pulse.
- Clap twice as fast. 
- Clap twice as slow. 
- Alternate clapping fast, normal and slow.

With this exercice, we have seen binary division of time. But it is perfectly fine to divide the pulse in 3, 5 or 7 sub-pulses to create even more intricate results.

Examples of ternary subvision are easily found with most blues songs (I would suggest to do the exercice on "Still Got The Blues" by Gary Moore, as it is slow and subdivions are heavily marked).

### 1.2 The sound of silence

A non negligeable part of rhythm is silence. Let us modify the previous exercice.

*Exercice :* 
- Listen to your favourite song and sing a note ("La") where the pulse is. Pitch does not matter here.
- Sing twice as fast. ("LaLaLaLa")
- Sing twice as slow and hold the note ("Laaaaaa")
- Clap twice as slow but don't hold the note ("La....La....")
- Alternate the duration. If your song choice has a clear melody, sing the rhythm of the melody.

## 2. Reading and writing rhythm.

### 2.1 How to read rhythm ?
