# Simply Mixing Part 7 - Compression II

This post tries to describe the basics of mixing music. Today, common compressions uses.

## 1. The uses of compression

We have seen that a compressor is an automated gain reducer. So, the most immediate use is *dynamic control*. But we will also see that it can be used in other ways, to give colour as well as movement to a track.

## 2. Hearing compression

Before going any further, we will try to hear what a compressor can do before anything else.

And what is better than an extreme setting, right ?

For starters, we will need a few signals to work with :

* Overheads : TODO
* Snare : TODO
* Guitar : TODO
* Bass : TODO

TODO


## 3. Dynamic control
### 3.1 Punch

### 3.2 Control

## 4. Density and colour

## 5. Movement
