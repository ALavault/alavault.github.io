# Simply Mixing Part 10 - Balancing

Now we have a first mix ready, let's work on balancing.

*But you should have written than before we did a mix...* A well processed mixed (almost) balances itself. And it is also more "flashy" to say you can use a compressor rather than saying you are master of balance.

Anyway, let's begin.

## 1. Focus level in a mix

Anybody can't focus on *everything* in any situation. 

Think of it as a picture with a foreground, a middle ground and a background. If you cram too much things in the foreground, you will not see whatever is behind and the picture will be hard to read. On the other hand, having only middle-ground is boring. And just background is... empty.

It seems a lot of people abide by the rule of "3 or less in the foregroud" : I don't know where it comes from but it seems to work...

In a mix (and music in general), we can identify several elements :

* Noise : not audible but having a non-zero level.
* Background elements : elements barely audible when focused on. They add *texture*. Think of a shaker or a synth pad.
* Supporting elements : elements quieter than the lead parts but supporting it. Think  a low harmony on a vocal during a chorus.
* Second-row elements : Does not support any lead but in not the main focus while still being capable of grabbing your attention. Think of a melodic counterpoint.
* Leading elements : the main thing heard when listening without focus. The obvious leader of the song (most of the time, the vocals). The band should still be heard though.
* Selfish leaders : you mixed too loud. Pull the fader down.

*Exercice :* Go back to your mix and play with the vocals.
- Pull the fader down all the way
- Raise it till it starts to be audible - it becomes a texture, a detail.
- Raise it more to make it support the rest of the mix
- Again, push the fader until it grabs somewhat your attention without being leading the song
- Push the fader until it leads the song while keeping the clarity of the mix
- Push the fader too much

While doing this exercice, try to "feel" the different loudness level and how it put your track into the different planes of focus.

*Note :* If you feel your mix is unbalanced after this exercice, go back to it and balance it "properly".

*Visualization :* The fader can be seen as a *focus fader* rather than an actual *volume fader*.
