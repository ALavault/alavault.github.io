# Simply Mixing Part 10 - Balancing

Now we have a first mix ready, let's work on balancing.

_But you should have written than before we did a mix..._ A well processed mixed (almost) balances itself. And it is also more "flashy" to say you can use a compressor rather than saying you are master of balance.

Anyway, let's begin.

## 1. Focus level in a mix

Anybody can't focus on _everything_ in any situation.

Think of it as a picture with a foreground, a middle ground and a background. If you cram too much things in the foreground, you will not see whatever is behind and the picture will be hard to read. On the other hand, having only middle-ground is boring. And just background is... empty.

It seems a lot of people abide by the rule of "3 or less in the foregroud" : I don't know where it comes from but it seems to work...

In a mix (and music in general), we can identify several elements :

- Noise : not audible but having a non-zero level.
- Background elements : elements barely audible when focused on. They add _texture_. Think of a shaker or a synth pad.
- Supporting elements : elements quieter than the lead parts but supporting it. Think a low harmony on a vocal during a chorus.
- Second-row elements : Does not support any lead but in not the main focus while still being capable of grabbing your attention. Think of a melodic counterpoint.
- Leading elements : the main thing heard when listening without focus. The obvious leader of the song (most of the time, the vocals). The band should still be heard though.
- Selfish leaders : you mixed too loud. Pull the fader down.

_Exercice :_ Go back to your mix and play with the vocAnywals.

- Pull the fader down all the way
- Raise it till it starts to be audible - it becomes a texture, a detail. Mute it on and off and check if you notice a difference (spoiler : you should)
- Raise it more to make it support the rest of the mix
- Again, push the fader until it grabs somewhat your attention without being leading the song
- Push the fader until it leads the song while keeping the clarity of the mix
- Push the fader too much

While doing this exercice, try to "feel" the different loudness level and how it put your track into the different planes of focus.

_Note :_ If you feel your mix is unbalanced after this exercice, go back to it and balance it "properly".

_Visualization :_ The fader can be seen as a _focus fader_ rather than an actual _volume fader_.

_Remark_ : in my experience, there is around 3-4dB between each "level".

## 2. Making choices

Mixing is is mostly a succession of trade-offs. _You_ are here to make these tradeoffs.

But before making tradeoffs we need to have all the elements at our disposal to create a _vision_ : what do you _hear_ ?

By "What do you hear ?", I mean do you think of something anthemic, something intimate, something tense...

This is your vision, and your mix should show that.

_Exercice :_ Listen to a song you like and write the feelings you get from it. Listen _critically_ to find the balance of the different elements. Does this balance satisfy you ?

_Exercice :_ Go back to your first mix and try to take a step back and build your _vision_. Try to make it happen !

## 3. The drums

Mixing (real) drums is a job within the job. So, let's talk about it.

Most drum recordings have two kinds of tracks : point mics and ambiance mics. Points mics are the kick, the snare and the toms in general. Ambiance mics comprise the overheads and the room mics.

By putting the point mics to loud, it will make the drums sound disconnected and unreal. On the other hand, mixing the ambiance mics to loud will destroy any kind of clarity, especially because of the cymbals.

Also, do not put anything on top of the other tracks so much it feels disconnected : a hi-hat way too loud can destroy your track, even in trap music. Same with shakers.

So, a little cheat-list :

- The kick should match the song : energetic and punchy for Machine Head, soft and pillowy for jazz.
- Kick and snare should be roughly at the same level : you can get away with a small gap of course, but no snare solo please.
- Snare drum and vocals share some frequencies (200 and 3k roughly) : mix the snare accordingly.
- Snare drum sound is specific to every genre : deep metal snare in rock, 808 in hip-hop. Do your homework.
- Toms are special beasts : they episodic low-end. Mix then not so loud it pumps your master limiter/compressor.
- Tom fills should be heard : not doing will result in weak transitions, destroying the song and its emotional impact.
- Room mics should be mixed between background and supporting with a role of sonic glue : if you mute the rooms and your drum mix falls apart, it is (somewhat) a good sign.
- Cymbals (and by extension overheads) are almost surely not the center of attention : mix them under the kick and snare as a supporting element to give the drum kit a sense of cohesion.
- By bussing the kick, snare and toms, it makes it easier to adjust the level of the whole package rather than each track.

_Remark :_ Musically, cymbals are generally accenting beats : not having them is likely to destroy the _groove_ of your track.

_Tip :_ During tom fills, ride the room mics up. It makes them bigger, if that is what you are looking after. 3-4dB should do the trick.
