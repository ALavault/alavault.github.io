# Simply Mixing Part 10 - Balancing

Now we have a first mix ready, let's work on balancing.

_But you should have written than before we did a mix..._ A well processed mixed (almost) balances itself. And it is also more "flashy" to say you can use a compressor rather than saying you are master of balance.

Anyway, let's begin.

## 1. Focus level in a mix

Anybody can't focus on _everything_ in any situation.

Think of it as a picture with a foreground, a middle ground and a background. If you cram too much things in the foreground, you will not see whatever is behind and the picture will be hard to read. On the other hand, having only middle-ground is boring. And just background is... empty.

It seems a lot of people abide by the rule of "3 or less in the foregroud" : I don't know where it comes from but it seems to work...

In a mix (and music in general), we can identify several elements :

- Noise : not audible but having a non-zero level.
- Background elements : elements barely audible when focused on. They add _texture_. Think of a shaker or a synth pad.
- Supporting elements : elements quieter than the lead parts but supporting it. Think a low harmony on a vocal during a chorus.
- Second-row elements : Does not support any lead but in not the main focus while still being capable of grabbing your attention. Think of a melodic counterpoint.
- Leading elements : the main thing heard when listening without focus. The obvious leader of the song (most of the time, the vocals). The band should still be heard though.
- Selfish leaders : you mixed too loud. Pull the fader down.

_Exercice :_ Go back to your mix and play with the vocAnywals.

- Pull the fader down all the way
- Raise it till it starts to be audible - it becomes a texture, a detail. Mute it on and off and check if you notice a difference (spoiler : you should)
- Raise it more to make it support the rest of the mix
- Again, push the fader until it grabs somewhat your attention without being leading the song
- Push the fader until it leads the song while keeping the clarity of the mix
- Push the fader too much

While doing this exercice, try to "feel" the different loudness level and how it put your track into the different planes of focus.

_Note :_ If you feel your mix is unbalanced after this exercice, go back to it and balance it "properly".

_Visualization :_ The fader can be seen as a _focus fader_ rather than an actual _volume fader_.

_Remark_ : in my experience, there is around 3-4dB between each "level".

## 2. Making choices

Mixing is is mostly a succession of trade-offs. _You_ are here to make these tradeoffs.

But before making tradeoffs we need to have all the elements at our disposal to create a _vision_ : what do you _hear_ ?

By "What do you hear ?", I mean do you think of something anthemic, something intimate, something tense...

This is your vision, and your mix should show that.

_Exercice :_ Listen to a song you like and write the feelings you get from it. Listen _critically_ to find the balance of the different elements. Does this balance satisfy you ?

_Exercice :_ Go back to your first mix and try to take a step back and build your _vision_. Try to make it happen !

## 3. Case study - Drums

Mixing (real) drums is a job within the job. So, let's talk about it.

Most drum recordings have two kinds of tracks : point mics and ambiance mics. Points mics are the kick, the snare and the toms in general. Ambiance mics comprise the overheads and the room mics.

By putting the point mics to loud, it will make the drums sound disconnected and unreal. On the other hand, mixing the ambiance mics to loud will destroy any kind of clarity, especially because of the cymbals.

Also, do not put anything on top of the other tracks so much it feels disconnected : a hi-hat way too loud can destroy your track, even in trap music. Same with shakers.

So, a little cheat-list :

- The kick should match the song : energetic and punchy for Machine Head, soft and pillowy for jazz.
- Kick and snare should be roughly at the same level : you can get away with a small gap of course, but no snare solo please.
- Snare drum and vocals share some frequencies (200 and 3k roughly) : mix the snare accordingly.
- Snare drum sound is specific to every genre : deep metal snare in rock, 808 in hip-hop. Do your homework.
- Toms are special beasts : they episodic low-end. Mix then not so loud it pumps your master limiter/compressor.
- Tom fills should be heard : not doing will result in weak transitions, destroying the song and its emotional impact.
- Room mics should be mixed between background and supporting with a role of sonic glue : if you mute the rooms and your drum mix falls apart, it is (somewhat) a good sign.
- Cymbals (and by extension overheads) are almost surely not the center of attention : mix them under the kick and snare as a supporting element to give the drum kit a sense of cohesion.
- By bussing the kick, snare and toms, it makes it easier to adjust the level of the whole package rather than each track.

_Remark :_ Musically, cymbals are generally accenting beats : not having them is likely to destroy the _groove_ of your track.

_Tip :_ During tom fills, ride the room mics up. It makes them bigger, if that is what you are looking after. 3-4dB should do the trick.

## 4. Case study - Vocals

Balancing between lead and backing vocals is tricky and can change drastically the feel of the song.

A rule of thumb is the more backing you have, the more epic it is. The less you have, the more intimate it is.

Most of the time, harmonies and background vocal are panned : look what already occupies the spot (cymbals, stereo synth, guitars...) and balance accoringly.

So, a cheat-list :

- Harmonies smooth the performance (in terms of details and dynamics) of the lead and give more width. Balance according to your vision.
- Pan your harmonies further to the sides the higher they are : it will give width while keeping a centered low-end.
- Full pan might not be a good idea : it may clash with other instruments. Find the best compromise between width and clarity of the instruments.
- If you are mixing a counterpoint/answer, it should be noticed but not leading (second row element)
- Some vocal tracks may look like harmonies but are in fact doubles of the lead : they should be treated as part of the lead group.

## 5. A word on metering

Most DAW show _peak meters_ which means it shows the value of the highest peak found at a certain time.

But for human hearing, volume is mostly bound to the average volume.

The roughest measurement of an "average" is the RMS value (_Root mean squared_) over generally 300ms.

_Exercice :_ In your mix, put the snare drum and the guitar in solo. Level them such as their max peak levels are the same. The guitar will be way louder because they have a higher average value while the snare being mostly a transient has a lower average value.

Of course, RMS metering is not the best loudness measurement possible. The most up to date is described in the EBU R 128 standard where the _Loudness Unit_ is defined (if it the RMS on a filtered signal to put it simply). But before the R128 standard, a first try was the _K-system_ of Bob Katz.

Anyway, keep in mind that your meters are "lying". And red lights means (generally) nothing.

## 6. Automation

Sometimes, a _static mix_ does not cut it : too much compromises. What if we could make a mix evolving throughout the song.

Well, we can. This is call _automation_ and it basically automating parameters like volume, pan, sends, mute, solo or plugins.

With balancing, we will only look at volume automation.

Each DAW has its way of writing automation : check their documentation.

They are three main objectives with automation : excitement, balance or correction.

By "balance", I mean automating volume to keep a vocal performance consistant or to ride a part for a section. These are "long" automation.

By "excitement", I mean short automation to make a lead guitar rise to its solo or to ride the toms during an awesome fills. These are "short" automation.

By "correction", I mean correcting problems happening in specific spots while the rest gives satisfying results. Think of a fast double kick pattern : a high-pass should be applied to avoid a low-end build up making a mess (and riding the rooms down too) while keeping the rest of the song unchanged.

Of course, these are personnal and should be use if and only if the mix needs it.

It is a great way to get your mixes to the next level though.
