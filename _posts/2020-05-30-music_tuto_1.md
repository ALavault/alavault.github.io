# Simple music Part 1 : pitch

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, the musical notes.

DISCLAIMER : I know a musical note describe pitch and duration as the same time. For the sake of simplicity, we will only describe pitches here.

## 1. Basic physics

Music is sound. And sound is a vibratory phenomenon. 

Put simply, sound is some air wiggling.

But we are dealing with musical notes here, and musical notes have a *pitch*. This translate physically as the existence of *fundamental frequency* and *harmonics*.

*Frequency ?* : how fast or slow the sound is making the air vibrate. 

*Harmonics ?* : multiple of the fundamental frequency. They define the timbre of a sound.

The lower the frequency, the lower the note is.

### 1. 1. Answers to questions you didn't ask

You can skip this part as it only adds a few remarks.

*Anharmonic sounds* : sounds with a fundemental frequency but no harmonics exists. For instance, a snare drum has a fundamental but its "harmonics" are not multiple of the fundamental. 
Another kind of anharmonic sound is noise : white noise, pink noise or simply the letter "S" : 10€ if you can give a pitch to a "S".

*White noise* : a white noise is a signal whose spectral density is constant. In other words, it contains every frequencies (in a specified bandwidth).

## 2. Tempering with temperament

In western music, the most common tuning system is the *12-tone equal-temperament*.

*Tuning what ?* : a tuning system is a way of defining which pitches are "good". Since we can have an infinity of frequencies, having a tuning system reduce the number of combination possible.

A tuning system is relative to a reference : the most used in modern western music is called *La-440* or *A-440*. 

### 2. 1. Back to the... physics

There is more than 12 note in total : a piano has 88 differents keys. In fact, what is decomposed in 12 tone is an interval called an *octave*.

*Octave* : two sounds are an octave apart when one has its fundamental double of the other.

So the range of a piano spans : 88/12 = 7.33 octaves and every 12 twelve consecutive keys, we get a sound whose fundamental is doubled.

Now that we know from where the 12 tones come from, let us work on the equal temperament part.

*Equal temperament* : if an octave is divided into 12 tones, it follows and 12-tone equal temperament if and only if an octave is divided in pitches such as the ratio of the frequencies of any adjacent pair of pitches is the same.

On a piano, it means the ratio of frequencies between to adjacent keys is the same.

### 2. 2. Answers to questions you didn't ask

*Can I have more than 12 tone per octave* : Yes. It is common is non-western music...

*A-440 is always true, right ?* : No. Most of Pantera album were recorded at A-435 for instance. A-442 is common in orchestral music and A-415 is common in baroque music.

## 3. Giving notes a (bad) name

Now we have divided our frequencies based on our tuning reference, we can start giving these 12 tones some names.

### 3. 1. Naming convention

We have already a name for our reference, La or A. La is most common in latin countries while A is most common is anglo-saxon countries.

The note names are :

> A/La, B/Si, C/Do, D/Ré, E/Mi, F/Fa, G/Sol.

To get more precise, we can describe the octave in which the note is in. The reference is La4 or A4.

For a given number, the notes follow the order written above.

### 3. 2. Alterations, half-tone and enharmony

*But I count only seven names for twelve tones !*

Good remark. If you look at a piano, the white keys correspond to the name given above. But there are black keys.

#### 3. 2. 1. Half and whole tone

An octave is divided into 12 sub-intervals called *semi-tones* or *half-tones*. A *whole tone* is worth two half-tones.

*What ?*  And the notes A,B,C... have a certain relationship between them. Great...

#### 3. 2. 2. Relationship between the note names

There is a whole tone between La & Si, Do & Ré, Ré & Mi, Fa & Sol and Sol & La.

There is a half tone between Si & Do and Mi & Fa.

With this relationship, we made a major scale if we start on Do and a natural minor scale if we start on La.

But it means there are 5 notes we have not defined yet in between the whole tones.... (Oh and look, it's exactly the number of black keys in an octave)

#### 3. 2. 3. Alterations

To give a name to the "black keys", we have to introduce the *sharp* (♯) and the *flat* (♭). These are called alterations.

A sharp means the note is altered to the half-tone above.

A flat means the note is altered to the half-tone below.

An enharmonic equivalence happens when two notes spelled differently refers to the same pitch e.g. Si♯ = Do and Fa♭=Mi

We can then define the following 5 remaining notes :

> Do♯/Ré♭, Ré♯/Mi♭, Fa♯/Sol♭, Sol♯/La♭, La♯/Si♭, 


### 3.3. Wrapping it up

An octave is divided into 12 notes. There are seven unaltered notes, but with thanks to the alterations, we can get 12 notes in an octave.

## 4. Actual examples on instruments
### 4. 1. Piano

### 4. 2. Guitar

![drum-pattern](/assets/img/posts/guitar-notes-chart-tab.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Finding notes on the guitar is actually way harder than the piano.

Contrary to the piano where each key equals one note, the notes on the guitar can overlap i.e. the same note can be played at different places.

First, let us talk about the tuning of a guitar. The most standard tuning is from low to high E-A-D-G-B-E : it is called *E standard tuning*.

Two adjacent frets on the same string are a half-tone apart. The same fret on different strings means the interval between the notes is the same as the one between the strings.

But all of this is true for the E standard tuning only. Since there is a plethora of tuning out there (open tunings, drop tuning, NST, all-fourth....), it is one of the hardest subject to master for any wanabee guitarist.
