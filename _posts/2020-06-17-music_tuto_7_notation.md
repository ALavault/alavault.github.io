# Simply Music Part 7 - Notating and transcribing music

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, writing a lead sheet.

## 1. The need for persistence

Writing music was a few (a big few) years back the most common way to make your music heard. Not concerts, not records. Sheet music.

Because of that, we have manuscript from the middle ages as well as lots of classical composers.

This music is heard nowadays because it has been *written*.

You should write *everything* you create. While recording yourself is a great way to store little snippets (a melody hook), only paper can keep track of your most famous arrangements with bagpipes, canon and ducks. Sounds like an awful mix though.

## 2. Transcription : Alan Walker - Fade

Well, the title says it all. Write a transcription of this song.

This is how I would proceed.

### 2.1 The structure

Before going head first, take a step back and listen to what makes the song : its structure.

Count the number of bars (or the timestamps) where you feel something different happens : a change in melody, a new rhythmic pattern etc...

Then give a letter to each of these section. If two sections sounds really similar but one has an harmonized melody (for instance) call these section X1 and X2 : it means the melody and the harmony is the same as part X but there is some variations.

Also, find the tempo. Most likely 128 I guess...

Once you have the structure, you can go transcribe the whole.

### 2.2 Rough transcription

Since I already found the structure, I know I can transcribe one of them and the other should have minor differences.

*My method:* Sing the notes you hear. And play them on your instrument of choice. Unless you have an absolute ear or a awfully great relative ear. I don't, so I need an instrument.

Anyway, once you find the note, write it down. You will refine the rhythm later.

For the harmony, think of the chord and sing each notes contained in the chord. It can be really hard in the beginning.

*Hint :* The harmony of this song is quite simple, triads will suffice.

*Hint :* 

This is generally sufficient for a lead sheet.

### 2.3 Polishing things up

Once our rough structure and transcription is done, you can go further and pick all the little details here and there : what the drums play, where the riser occurs etc.

### 2.4 Play it.

I think it is clear enough.

Have fun doing transcriptions. While it is hard in the beginning, it's incredibly rewarding ! And it is a great way to learn how to write !
