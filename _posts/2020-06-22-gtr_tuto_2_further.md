# Simple Guitar Part 2 : Going further

This post tries to describe the basics of guitar. Today, strenghening the basics.

Requirements : a guitar (with six strings) and Simply Guitar part 1.

## 1. Tablatures

There are two main ways of transcribing music for the guitar : tablatures and sheet music.

Reading sheet music is really hard on guitar, this is why we will not cover it deeply in this series.

So, let us learn about the tablature.

![tab](/assets/img/posts/come-as-you-are.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
<center><i>Top : sheet music., Bottom : tablature</i></center>

A *tablature* (or tab for short) is a musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than the actual pitches. 

For instance, the chords E minor, G major and C major (from part 1) are going to be notated like this :

```
e|---0----3----0--
B|---0----3----1--
G|---1----0----0--
D|---2----0----2--
A|---2----2----3--
E|---0----3-------
     Em   G    C
```

*Remark:* Em is a shorter notation for E minor.

Let us read all of this :

* On the left, we have the letter defining which tuning we are using. Here, we are using the E standard tuning.
* The tablature is read from left to right, just like a regular sheet music.
* The horizontal lines represent each of the 6 strings. The highest string (e) is at the top, the lowest string (E). 
* On each lines are numbers : these numbers represents the fret number. "0" means it uses an open string.
* Stacked notes (just like the example) should be played at the same time.


*Remark* : The "e" notation is used to avoid confusion with the lowest E.

*Exercice :* Write the tablature for the A major chord as well as the D minor chord (see part 1)

*Answer :*

```
e|---0---1---
B|---2---3---
G|---2---2---
D|---2---0---
A|---0-------
E|-----------
     A   Dm 
``` 

But tablatures can also be used to write singles notes phrases. As an example, we will "tab" the C major scale, in two different ways.

CAGED fingering 

```
e|---------------------
B|---------------------
G|-------------2-4-5---
D|-------2-3-5---------
A|---3-5---------------
E|---------------------
```

Three notes per string :

```
e|-----------------------------------------8-10-12-8-
B|-----------------------------------10-12-----------
G|---------------------------9-10-12-----------------
D|-------------------9-10-12-------------------------
A|-----------8-10-12---------------------------------
E|---8-10-12-----------------------------------------
```

*Exercice :* 
1. While practising these scale pattern, remark the notes are only C,D,E,F,G,A,B.
2. These patterns can be transposed up and down the neck. Play the G major scale with both fingering.
   (*Hint : The G on the A string is at 10, you have a G on the E string at 3)

One advantage on the guitar is we "only" have to learn patterns rather than actual notes. But knowing where the notes are on your fretboard is important, but we will work on that later. : not doing so is equivalent 

## 2. Strumming pattern

Strumming is the most common way of playing the guitar as an accompaniment instrument.

And if there is one pattern you should know it is this one :

![pattern](/assets/img/posts/strum.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The squares and the V indicate the strumming pattern : square for downstrokes, V for upstrokes.

Note the down strokes are on the beat while the upstrokes are on the downbeats.
: not doing so is equivalent 

*Muting the lowest strings :* While the last part talked about keeping the thumb behind the neck, we are introducing an exception here : on chords that do require to play the low E string, you should bring your thumb around the neck to mute the said string.

Indeed, if you did not mute this string, it would change the chord you play and it is most likely going to sound "bad".

## 3. Easier transitions.

A somewhat weird "trick" I can give you to make your transitions between chords smoother is... to play the open strings !

If you do so on the last downbeat, you will have time to reposition your fingers and it is not going to be picked up by the listener.

*Exercice :* 
1. While playing "the pattern", play the chords as written. It is hard to transition efficiently as higher tempos

```

   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1
e|-2---2-2---2-2-2-|-3---3-3---3-3-3-|-3---3-3---3-3-3-|-2-||
B|-3---3-3---3-3-3-|-3---3-3---3-3-3-|-3---3-3---3-3-3-|-3-||

D|-0---0-0---0-0-0-|-2---2-2---2-2-2-|-0---0-0---0-0-0-|-0-||
A|-----------------|-3---3-3---3-3-3-|-2---2-2---2-2-2-|---||

   D                 Cadd9             G                 D
```

2. Same pattern but playing open strings on the last downbeat. The transitions are easier.

```
4/4

   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1
e|-2---2-2---2-2-0-|-3---3-3---3-3-0-|-3---3-3---3-3-0-|-2-||
B|-3---3-3---3-3-0-|-3---3-3---3-3-0-|-3---3-3---3-3-0-|-3-||
G|-2---2-2---2-2-0-|-0---0-0---0-0-0-|-0---0-0---0-0-0-|-2-||
D|-0---0-0---0-0-0-|-2---2-2---2-2-0-|-0---0-0---0-0-0-|-0-||
A|-----------------|-3---3-3---3-3-0-|-2---2-2---2-2-0-|---||
E|-----------------|-----------------|-3---3-3---3-3-0-|---||
   D                 Cadd9             G                 D
```

These chords have some commons fingers between them (e.g the 3-3 at the top of the Cadd9 and the G chord). Try to keep them in place : the less you move, the faster and the smoother you will be able to transition.

*Remark :* You do not need to play the open strings hit exactly as written. Experimenting with this is a great learning experience.

## 4. Skip strings, not school

String skipping is highly useful to play more interesting arpeggios or melodies.

Here is a little pattern to work on that !

```
4/4

   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   
e|-------2-------2-|-------3-------3-|-------0-------0-|-------0-------0-||
B|---3-------3-----|---3-------3-----|---3-------3-----|---3-------3-----||
G|-----2-------2---|-----2-------2---|-----2-------2---|-----0-------0---||
D|-0-------0-------|-0-------0-------|-0-------0-------|-0-------0-------||
A|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------||
E|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------||
   D                 Dsus4             Dsus2                 Dsus4add9
```

Two ways of playing this : either with your fingers or with a pick.

With the fingers : the plucking hand fingering is thumb-major-index-ring

With a pick : It is downstroke-upstroke all the way. Do not cheat !
