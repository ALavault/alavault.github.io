# Simple Guitar Part 1 : The instrument and first steps

This post tries to describe the basics of guitar. Today, meeting with the instrument.

Requirements : a guitar (with six strings)

## 1. I have a guitar. Now what ?

Congratulations ! You have your first guitar !

### 1.1 How to hold it ?

There are two main ways of holding a guitar while sitting down. We will call them the *classical* and the *casual* way respectively.

#### 1.1.1 The classical way

![classical-position](/assets/img/posts/placeholder.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The *classical position* is called like this because it is highly common among classical guitar players.

Advantages :
* puts your wrist in a better position for stretching in higher frets.
* better picking angles
* makes playing standing up on par with your sitting technique.

Drawbacks :
* requires sitting straight
* unconfortable to play full chords

DIY :
* TODO


#### 1.1.2 The casual way

![casual-position](/assets/img/posts/placeholder.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The *casual position* is due to the more relaxed position of the player on the instrument. We could also call it the "campfire position".

Advantages :
* More confortable to play in general
* struming and power chords are easier to play

Drawbacks :
* generally implies hunchback
* does not translate well with playing standing up

DIY :
* TODO

Since this article is more focus on non-classical playing, I would suggest you to start with the *casual position*.



### 1.2 How to tune it ?

#### 1.2.1 The strings

![strings](/assets/img/posts/placeholder.png){:class="img-responsive"}

On a standard 6 string guitar, the tuning is, from low to high, E-A-D-G-B-E (or Mi-La-RÃ©-Sol-Si-Mi)

*Don't know your notes ? [Check this post !]({% post_url 2020-05-30-music_tuto_1_notes %})

*Vocabulary :* the lowest string is the called the 6th string, the highest the 1st. 

#### 1.2.2 The headstock

Your guitar has a *headstock* with *tuning machines*. These are used to tighten or loossen the string up to the desired pitch.

*Exercice :* 
1. Pluck a string of your choice. Find the tuning machine connected to this string. 
2. Turn the tuning machine peg (aka tuning peg) 1/4 turn (or less) in one direction of your choice : does the pitch becomes higher or lower ?
3. Turn a 1/4 turn (or less) in the other direction : does the pitch becomes higher or lower ?

#### 1.2.3 The tuning

I assume here you either have a *tuner* or a *tuner app* on your smartphone. It works the same way anyway.

We remind you the equivalence between string number and notes :

String Number | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 
Note name     | E2| A2| D3| G3| B3| E4

DIY : Let's tune your guitar !
1. Pluck the 6th string (the lowest).
2. Turn the tuning peg is one direction : is the pitch lower or higher now ?
3. Check the tuner : if tuned, it should indicate E2. Please note that some tuner only indicate E.
   1. Turn the tuning peg to match the note.
   2. Always try to *tune up* to the note i.e. the pitch should go from low to high while turning the tuning peg.
   3. Try your best to not make the other strings ringing : it will give you a bad reading.
4. Once you are done with the 6th string, repeat with the 5th, 4th etc....

*Advice :* NEVER practice out of tune ! NEVER !

## 2. First steps.

### 2.1 Playing single notes

There two ways of playing notes on a guitar : by playing *open strings* or by *fretting the string*.

*Open strings* are the notes played when you were tuning the guitar : the string moves freely without any action from the fretting hand.

*Fretted string* are the rest. 

To fret a string, position your fretting hand somewhat correctly : your thumb should be placed on the middle of the neck and your fingers should rest without tension on the fretboard.

Frets are named after their position on the fretboard : the first fret is the closest to the head stock, the second follows etc...

You may have noticed your fretboard have inlays on it or on its side : this indicates which number the fret is.

Commonly, the marked frets are the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 12th (and then repeating again). The 12th fret is generally marked with a double dot.

*Exercice : * 
1. Find the 5th fret. Mark it in a non-invasive way (e.g. with painter tape)
Please note that by saying "fret x", we are in fact designating the zone between the x-1 th fret and the x th fret.

We are now going to play our firsts notes ! We will start with our index of our fretting hand.

*Technique :*
* While keeping a correct thumb position (roughly on the middle of the neck), use your finger to press the targeted string onto the fingerboard between the targeted frets.
* Adjust the position of your finger in order to make it closer to the furthest fret from the headstock without going over it.

*Example :* Let us fret the 5th fret on the 5th string (the A/La string)

* While keeping the same thumb position, identify the 4th and 5th frets (Count them out loud).
* Press your index finger between the 4th and 5th frets, closest to the 5th as possible.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tuning#Open_strings

### 2.2 Exercices for singles notes
*Vocabulary :* Your 1st finger on your fretting is the index, the 2nd the major etc...

*General guideline :* 
* These exercices should be done slowly and without a metronome in the beginning. Add one when possible.
* Try not to make unplayed string ring.
* Do not tense up : its a guitar, not a chainsaw.
* Stop whenever you feel pain, especially in your wrist.
single notes
*Exercice 1 :* Fingers

To avoid imbalances between fingers, this is a fun exercice to begin with.

The idea here is to play each finger on successive frets on one string : 1st finger on 1st fret, 2nd finger on 2nd fret etc...

Since the stretch between the first frets can be difficult to handle for beginners, I would suggest you start with your 1st finger on the 7th fret, your 2nd finger on the 8th etc...

Repeat on every string, from low to high and back. 

*Exercice 2* : Finger Twister 1

If we notated the Exercice 1, we would have the following fingering : 1-2-3-4

To add more fun we will also add some permutations : 2-3-4-1, 3-4-1-2, 4-1-2-3

Redo Exercice 1 but when changing strings, you also change of finger permutation.

*Exercice 3* Finger Twister 2

Do the Exercice 2 with the base fingering 4-3-2-1, 4-2-3-1, 1-3-2-4, 1-2-4-3 and 3-4-2-1.

*Hint :* write all the permutations on a piece of paper, it makes them easier to remember.

### 2.3 Playing chords

Playing chords on the guitar is somewhat easy as these chords are made of finger patterns which can be transposed up and down the neck.

For the moment, we will not care about the theory behind the chords. You can have more details [here !]({% post_url 2020-06-09-music_tuto_4_harmony %})

There are *8 chords* which are easy to learn on the guitar.

![8chords](/assets/img/posts/8chords.png){:class="img-responsive"}

*How can I read that ?* It actually quite simple !

Each diagram represents the guitar neck viewed from the front. 

* From left to right, the vertical lines represents the strings from the lowest/6th to the highest/1st.
* The bold horizontal line represents the nut
* The thin horintal lines represents the fret
  
And now to transfer this to the guitar :

* Above the nut/bold line, you can see "0" and "X". "0" means the string is played open, and "X" means the string is not played and hence should not be heard.
* Between the thin lines, just like your fingers between the frets, the black dots represents the position of your fingers. 
* The numbers inside the black are a suggested fingering for the chord. We remind you that 1=index, 2=major, 3=ring, 4=pinky

Once your finger are placed correctly, strum the strings with your thumb : all the notes should ring.

In case some note are choked, check your thumb position : it should not be over the neck. 

You should also your fretting finger position : your fingers should curve gracefully. Think of little hammers hitting the strings.

### 2.3 Your first chord progression

We are going to play the progession C major - A minor - D minor - Gmajor

1. Play each chord one after the other. Start slowly ! Mute all the strings before transitioning to another one.
2. Now play each chords 4 times before transitioning the other. 

Congratulations ! You played your first progression !

### 2.4 A musical example : 21 Guns by Green Day

The verses of this song follow the progression D minor - Bb major - F major - C major.

To allow us to play it with the chords we know, we will transpose it 2 semitone higher. We then get : E minor - C major - G major - D major.

In case you want to play along with the track, you can use a capo on the 10th fret while keeping the fingering of E minor etc...

1. Play the chords one after the other. Pay attention to the transitions.
2. Now play each chords 4 times before transitioning the other. 
3. Now, let's add a different rhythm. A simplified rhythm can be written like
```
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &
    x   x x x   x x
```
