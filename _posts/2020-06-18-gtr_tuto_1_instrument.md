# Simple Music Part 5 : Harmony II

This post tries to describe the basics of guitar. Today, meeting with the instrument.

Requirements : a guitar (with six strings)

## 1. I have a guitar. Now what ?

Congratulations ! You have your first guitar !

### 1.1 How to hold it ?

There are two main ways of holding a guitar while sitting down. We will call them the *classical* and the *casual* way respectively.

#### 1.1.1 The classical way

The *classical position* is called like this because it is highly common among classical guitar players.

Advantages :
* puts your wrist in a better position for stretching in higher frets.
* better picking angles
* makes playing standing up on par with your sitting technique.

Drawbacks :
* requires sitting straight
* unconfortable to play full chords

DIY :
* TODO


#### 1.1.2 The casual way

The *casual position* is due to the more relaxed position of the player on the instrument. We could also call it the "campfire position".

Advantages :
* More confortable to play in general
* struming and power chords are easier to play

Drawbacks :
* generally implies hunchback
* does not translate well with playing standing up

DIY :
* TODO

Since this article is more focus on non-classical playing, I would suggest you to start with the *casual position*.

### 1.2 How to tune it ?

#### 1.2.1 The strings

![strings](/assets/img/posts/placeholder.png){:class="img-responsive"}

On a standard 6 string guitar, the tuning is, from low to high, E-A-D-G-B-E (or Mi-La-RÃ©-Sol-Si-Mi)

*Vocabulary :* the lowest string is the called the 6th string, the highest the 1st. 

#### 1.2.2 The headstock

Your guitar has a *headstock* with *tuning machines*.
