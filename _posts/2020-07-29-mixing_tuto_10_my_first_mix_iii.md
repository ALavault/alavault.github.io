# Simply Mixing Part 10 - My first mix III

Let us continue where we left off from part I...

We got drums, we need the rest.

## 1. Being vocal about noise

Vocals are one of the most dynamic signal you can get. So... Compression time !

Filtering the vocals is very important, especially on badly recorded vocals : you get noises, room resonances... A lot of bad stuff.

Also, editing noises is important. Indeed, you can hear some bleed in the tracks : cut it out at the source !

For breathing noises, well, the choice is yours : leave them, cut them or attenuate them. Follow your artistic vision ;)

## 2. Background gang

We have special background vocals : they are *gang vocals* i.e. a group of people shouting stuff.

To get them wide, I would suggest to pan them as 100/33/33/100.

In terms of EQ and compression, do it on the bus : it will "glue" them and spare processing power.

As a chain, I would go :
* EQ + filters
* Fast compressor (1176 style)
* Slow compressor (LA-2A style)
* Limiter

If you want to use levelling tools such as Waves VocalRider or SonicAnomaly VOLA2, use them on each tracks. At least, I find it better this way.

You can go "overboard" with the compression on background vocals without ending sounding bad : since they are supporting elements, they do not need as much dynamic.

## 3. Gang leader

The main course : the lead vocals.

Again, editing is key : get rid of noises and make your choice on breathing noises.

In addition to the chain I showed above, we are going to use distortion.

*But these are vocals, not guitars...* I am not saying we are going to put the vocals through a guitar amp, but rather add a slight amount of distortion to them.

The rest of the tracks will "absorb" this distortion but the vocals are going to be clearer.

This is going to happen on every lead vocal tracks.

Another way of doing it uses parallel processing. You can experiment with :

* Parallel distortion (SansAmp style)
* Parallel compression
* Parallel compression + distortion (1176 all-buttons in/British mode)

I personnaly have a channel ready with an 1176 in British mode if I need more distortion. I don't use it all the time, but here, it can be helpful.

In terms of balance, the vocals should be the thing on top of the track : push the fader accordingly !

## 4. Slithering snakes and S

If you EQ a lot of top end, you find a lot of whistling noise on s and f for instance. These are called *sibilants*.

To get rid of them, you can use a de-esser : it is simply a multiband compressor applying compression on the "s" region (between 3-10k depending on the recording and singer).

I would go with de-essing track by track and with just a little bit of work (6dB of max gain reduction achieves good results in general).

I don't think these vocals are very sibilant so you may not need a de-esser.

If you want one, you can search the web. The Dead Duck plugin bunble has one and it is free.

## 5. Preset for vocals

In case you wanted a start point, hear you go :

On the tracks :

* Saturation : Airwindows Channel7 - Neve @ 100%
* Pre-EQ/filter : Stock EQ
* Vocal riding : Sonic Anomaly VOLA2 
* Limiter : Stock plugin/Loudmax

On the bus :

* EQ : Analog Obsession SSQ
* Fast compression : Analog Obsession Fetish - ratio@4:1, attack@3, release@7, up to 12dB of gain reduction (listen please)
* Slow/leveling compression : Analog Obsession LALA
* Special EQ : lkjb Luftikus (with 40k shelf)
* Limiter :stock/Loudmax
