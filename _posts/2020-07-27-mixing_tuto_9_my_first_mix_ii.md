# Simply Mixing Part 9 - My first mix II

Let us continue where we left off from part I...

We got drums, we need the rest.

## 1. All about that bass

### 1.1 Low end clarity

Two instruments will fight for the low end : the bass and the kick.

They cannot coexist *at the same level* : they will mask each other and create a mess.

So, you have to make a choice : which instrument will have the most low end extension ?

A quick checklist to have an idea :

* TODO
* TODO

In this song, I would go kick below the bass. In other words, the kick will be the king of low end.

### 1.2 The bass signal

Most basses are recorded *DI* (for *direct input*). This means the output of the bass is recorded raw, straight out of it, without going into an amp. Depending on the bass in might sounds great. Or not.

Here the recording is quite good : not a lot of noise and a good low end.

### 1.3 Processing the bass

First question : what is the function of the bass in this song ?

*Errr... Rhytmic fundation ?* Yes. It is not a bass solo.

Other point on the low end : kick or bass first ?

*Errr....* I would go with the kick as the bass is not "driving" the song. By that I mean the sub lows are going to be kick only : we will high-pass the bass.

#### 1.3.1 Filtering

Bass is mostly a low-end heavy instrument. The only information we have in the high-end are string noises : we will highpass AND lowpass the bass.

To set your filters listen in context with the kick.

Then EQ like we saw earlier.

Tips :  guideline frequencies on bass - 80 , 320, 800, 3k.

#### 1.3.2 New York Compression

NYC compression is basically a parallel compressor where are sent the drums AND the bass : it is useful to make your rhythm section gel together if does not work right away.

## 2. The guitars

The guitars have two functions in this song : rhythm and lead (solo). This means they should be treated differently, at least in terms of balance.

*But they are labeled 1,2,3... and there are DIs too.* Ditch the DIs. For the moment. And listen to each part and name them accordingly (lead solo, lead chorus, rhythm 1...)

Some parts are stereo files : don't pan them. Well, you can but I found they work well as is.

For the mono pairs, I would suggest to pan the rhythm guitars full right and left and keep mono pairs slightly in the center (e.g. 20/20 panning).

In terms of EQ, filtering the guitars is a must : it will avoid conflict with the bass and the vocals.

Highpass and lowpass : as a quick preset I would filter 100/10k. But of course, you need to find your own values !

### 2.1 Parallel processing on guitars

It is possible to use parallel processing on guitars just like, well, anything else.

Because we have already distorted guitars, we are not going to use a fast attack compressor.

I would use a setting similar to the "parallel punch" setting from the drum parallel compression section of the previous part.

Also, you can use an EQ to bring some lows and top (guideline : 150,8k)

I would suggest you use analog modeled plugin again since they bring intersting distortion.

### 2.2 Using the DIs

A word on these DIS : we can do a few things with them. The two big things are :

* Use them as transient enhancer
* Use them for reamping.

For the first application, just feather the DIs with the same panning as the corresponding track to enhance the transient definition : distorted guitars loose a lot of punch, distortion being a form of compression.

For the second one, you can use amp simulations to craft the sound you want or get a quad tracked rhythm guitars. I would do that on the solo DI since I think it lacks gain to cut through. But do as you please.

## 3. Noisy things with keys

There is something called "Hammond". That's an organ. And organs are bad.

*Why ?* I don't like the sound.

Anyway, let's think of the position of the organ in the mix : foreground, middle ground or background ?

For me, it's going to be a background element.

So, filter, EQ and compression.

*Why compress it ?* To make it take less space : it is a background element that should not peak through. Actually, I should have said *limiting*.





That's all for today. We will see the vocals. Next time ;)
