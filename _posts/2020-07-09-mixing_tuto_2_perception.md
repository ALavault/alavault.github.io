# Simply Mixing Part 2 - Perception

This post tries to describe the basics of mixing music. Today, an perception test.

## 1. Psychoacoustics

Before talking about anything technical about mixing, let's talk about your main tool : your ears.

### 1.1 Anatomy

The human ear consists of three parts :
* the outer ear
* the middle ear
* the inner ear.

The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity of the middle ear by the *eardrum*.

The middle ear contains three small bones (malleus, incus and stapes) called the ossicles involved in the mechanical transmission of sound.

The middle ear is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. 

The inner ear contains the otolith organs (the utricle and saccule) and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.

### 1.2 Frequency perception

As a complex the human ear can be, it is not the perfectly flat and high-bandwidth receiver. Evolution has made the ear "hearing" in a certain range while emphasing certain frequencies.

The diagram above represents the equal loudness lines with respect to the sound pressure level (dB SPL) and the frequency.

The *phon* is a unit of **perceived** loudness.

In other words, following a line means you hear all these frequencies at the same *perceived level* but they are actually putting your ear at different level of pressure.

Please note that the old measurements (the Fletcher-Munson curve) were really flat for 80*phon* and above while the new rone are more bumpy.

### 1.3 Auditory masking

Auditory masking in the frequency domain is known as simultaneous masking, frequency masking or spectral masking. Auditory masking in the time domain is known as temporal masking or non-simultaneous masking.

#### 1.3.1 Frequency masking

Frequency masking occurs when two sounds of two different frequencies are played at the same time while being perceived as "one" (a combination rather than two distinct sounds).

The ear have a certain selectivity (like a filter)  and when signals are perceived as a combination tone, they are said to reside in the same *critical bandwidth*.

#### 1.3.2 Temporal masking

This is more straightforward. Temporal masking occurs when a sudden sound makes inaudible other sounds which are present immediately preceding or following the stimulus. A good example of this type of masking is a percussion playing at the same time as a pitched instrument (e.g. kick drum and bass,even if there is also some frequency masking here).

### 1.4 Space perception 

This is related to space acoustics.

## 2. Visualizing audio

This part will talk about visual cues to better understand audio.

### 2.1 Fourier Transform

It would be great it we had something that could turn raw audio into an object dependant of the frequency...

Well, something like this exists and is known as the *Fourier Transform*. In other words, math time.

*No ! Maths ! My greatest enemy !* You are not alone. Maths are my greatest enemy too. But bear with me.

The Fourier transform allows us to change of domain

### 2.2 Spectra

A *spectrum* is a plot of the intensity with respect to the frequency. To obtain the spectrum of a sound, we need to change its domain from time to freequency with the Fourier Transform.
