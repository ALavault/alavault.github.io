# Simply Writing Part 2 - Basic arrangement

This post tries to describe the basics of writing music. Today, arrangement.

## 1. What is an arrangement ?

An arrangement is simply... the arrangement of parts to make a song.


## 2. Typical pop song arrangement

Most of pop songs follow the structure Intro-Verse-Build-Chorus-Verse-Build-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus(x2)

The most busy part in terms of part is generally the chorus.

Verses brings elements of story while choruses states the problem of the story (since these songs are lyrics driven).

Bridge is used as a contrasting element before the final conclusion with the last chorus. It brings tension, which should be resolved in the last choruses.

Builds (or pre-chorus) can be used (or not) to avoid too sharp of a transition between verses and chorus.

Of course, different styles call for different structures.

## 3. Playing with Lego

Arrangement should be confused with instrumentation which is the choice of instruments playing the parts in an arrangement.

On the other hand, an arrangement where you only have a piano and voice can be not enough.

As a visual analogy, think of an arrangement as a set of legos : you have a lot of differents parts to use but using them all everywhere is not really interesting.
