# Simple Music Part 5 : Harmony II

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, intervals, the natural minor scale.
## 1. Intervals. All of them... Most of them...

In Western music, the most common scheme for naming intervals gives two properties of the interval: the quality (perfect, major, minor, augmented, diminished) and the number (unison, second, third, etc.).

Let us build a table, counting the number of half-tone from a root note. Not all intervals are given, only the most commonly used.

> Number of semitones | Number | Quality 
> 0                   | Unison | Perfect
> 1                   | Second | Minor
> 2                   | Second | Major
> 3                   | Second/Third | Augmented/Minor
> 4                   | Third | Major
> 5                   | Fourth | Perfect
> 6                   | Fourth/Fifth | Augmented/Diminished
> 7                   | Fifth | Perfect
> 8                   | Fifth/Sixth | Augmented/Minor
> 9                   | Sixth/Seventh | Major/ Diminished
> 10                  | Seventh | Minor (Dominant) 
> 11                  | Seventh | Major
> 12                  | Octave | Perfect

*Oh shoot ! That's too much to handle ><'* Again, don't worry.

## 2. Naming intervals in a scale

To use our new-found knowledge on intervals, let's use the C major scale.

> C-D-E-F-G-A-B

The intervals are, in order, and with respect to C :

> major 2nd, major 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, major 6th, major 7th

This set of intervals *defines* the major scale.

*Exercice :* Write the G major scale. Check that the relationship between the intervals is still here.

*But if I start on a different note, like F for instance, while keeping the notes from the C major scale, I will not get the same intervals* 

Yes. This is called a mode. By the way, the scale you will get by starting of F is called the *Lydian scale* and can be described as a *major scale with an augmented fourth*. This will be detailed in another post.

## 3. Natural and relative minor

Major and natural minor scales are intrinsically related.

We can define a natural minor scale (note : this is typically called "minor scale") as the following set of intervals :

> major 2nd, minor 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, minor 6th, minor 7th

The *relative minor* scale of a certain major scale is the minor scale sharing its notes with the major scale chosen.

*Exercice :* Find the relative minor of C major. The relative minor of G major.

*Hint :* Look a third below the root.

## 4. Consonance and dissonance

Intervals can also be categorized in terms of consonance and dissonance. 

Consonance is typically associated with sweetness and are generally considered pleasing; dissonance on the other hand is associated with harshness and tension.

There are 4 types  :

1. Perfect consonances:
    * unisons and octaves
    * perfect fourths
    * perfect fifths
2. Imperfect consonances:
    * major seconds and minor sevenths
    * major thirds and minor sixths
    * minor thirds and major sixths
3. Soft Dissonances 
    * major 2nds minor 7ths
    * Perfect fourth
4. Sharp dissonances
   * minor 2nds and major 7ths

*Err... Some things are repeating...* Yes. Consonances and dissonances (the *sonance*) are relative to the music they are used in.

A tritone in medieval music is a blasphemy while it is almost consonant in jazz.

A fourth is sometimes consonant, sometimes dissonant.

Is does not really help you, right ? Let's take a piece of paper.

*Exercice :* Play each of these intervals and give them a "absolute harshness score" (this is personal).

Then, compare each interval to its neighbours and give them a "relative harshness score".

As an example, let us take a major third. I would give it 7/10 as an absolute rating.

When compared to the intervals below and above, I would give it 6/10 for the augmented second to major third and 8/10 for the perfect fourth to the major third.

*Hint :* these scores should reflect how "satisfied" you feel after the forced move between these intervals.

Now, your turn !

There are no wrong or right answer though. And keep this sheet and note the evolution in your taste during your musical journey !



## 5. Suspension, seventh chords and ninth cloud

### 5.1 Suspended chords

Any chord with a major or a minor third can have the third replaced by a major second or perfect fourth in order to form a suspended chord. 

As an example, given a C major triad (C-E-G), its suspended counterparts are Csus2 ("C suspended second") and Csus4 ("C suspended fourth"). The latter is sometimes notated Csus as it is the most common substitution.

*Storytime :* I thought for a long time that the *sus* abbreviation was for *substitution*. If it can help you remember what a suspended chord is.

*Exercice :* Try the following progression : Dsus4, Dsus2, D. Note your feelings about this type of resolution.

*Remark :* suspended chords are ambiguous. They are consonant and dissonant at the same time. Used at the right time, they are great songwriting devices.



### 5.2 Major seventh chords

We remind you that triads are stacked thirds. But we can stack another third on top of that !

*Seriously ?* Yop. And it sounds even more interesting !

Let's take a C major triad (C-E-G). If we stack another third, with respect to the C major scale, we need to find the third of G, which is B.

We then have C-E-G-B. Play this on your instrument of choice.

For guitar players I suggest the following voicing :

```
   Cmaj7
E|------
B|-8--5-
G|-9--4-
D|-9--5-
A|----3-
E|-8----
```

Such chord can be notated C*maj7*, C*maj*, C*ma7*, CΔ (C triangle) or CΔ7.

Minor chords with a major seventh exists of course : you can hear one in the James Bond theme. 

*Exercice :* 
1. Play both versions of the major seventh chord, both major and minor.
2. Write down the feeling you have when playing these chords : at ease, tense, hungry.... The answer is yours.


### 5.3 Minor seventh chords

The construction is the same.

Let us take the G major chord (G-B-D). If we stack with a third (with respect to D in the major scale), we end up with G-B-D-F.

Let us take the D minor triad (D-F-A). We then end up we D-F-A-C when stacking with another third.

A major chord with a minor seventh is also known as *dominant chord*. The minor seventh is also known as *dominant seventh*.

*Notation :* G7, Gdom7 for the dominant 7th chord. D*min7* or D*-7* for the minor seventh chord.

*Exercice :* 
1. Play both a G*7* chord and a D*min7* chord.
2. Write down what you feel about these chords. Tension, unrest, sleep...

For the guitar players, some voicings.

```
   C7     Cmin7
E|-------------
B|-8--5---8--4-
G|-8--3---8--3-
D|-9--5---8--5-
A|----3------3-
E|-8------8----
```

### 5.4 Beyond the seventh

If we want to write a half-diminished chord, we can't. Unless we write it down with a b5 somewhere : B-7(b5) is a valid way of writing a half-diminished chord.

We can also continue to stack thirds : we will end with the 9th, 11th and 13th.

*Exercice :* Experiments with stacking thirds. Note your feelings about the difference chords.

*Hint :* I like to see extend chords as polychords (i.e. two chords played on top of each other). For instance, a C*maj13* can be thought of as a C*maj7* on the bass topped by a D*min* triad.

Same with a Fmaj13(#11) : it can be seen as a F*maj7* topped of by a G major triad.

### 5.5 Beyond tertiary harmony

Of course, nothing force us to use chords built on thirds (aka tertiary harmony). We can use fourth or fifth. Even seconds.

*Exercice :* Have fun and experiment. Quartal (based on fourth) are somewhat common is modern fusion (e.g. Plini - Electric Sunrise) : start here.

See you next time !
