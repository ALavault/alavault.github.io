# Simple Music Part 5 : Harmony II

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, intervals and the natural minor scale.

## 1. Intervals. All of them...

In Western music, the most common scheme for naming intervals gives two properties of the interval: the quality (perfect, major, minor, augmented, diminished) and the number (unison, second, third, etc.).

Let us build a table, counting the number of half-tone from a root note. Not all itnervals are given, only the most commonly used.

> Number of semitones | Number | Quality 
> 0                   | Unison | Perfect
> 1                   | Second | Minor
> 2                   | Second | Major
> 3                   | Second/Third | Augmented/Minor
> 4                   | Third | Major
> 5                   | Fourth | Perfect
> 6                   | Fourth/Fifth | Augmented/Diminished
> 7                   | Fifth | Perfect
> 8                   | Fifth/Sixth | Augmented/Minor
> 9                   | Sixth/Seventh | Major/ Diminished
> 10                  | Seventh | Minor (Dominant) 
> 11                  | Seventh | Major
> 12                  | Octave | Perfect

*Oh shoot ! That's too much to handle ><'* Again, don't worry.

## 2. Naming intervals in a scale

To use our newfound knowledge on intervals, let's use the C major scale.

> C-D-E-F-G-A-B

The intervals are, in order, with respect to C :

> major 2nd, major 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, major 6th, major 7th

This set of intervals *defines* the major scale.

*Exercice :* Write the G major scale. Check that the relationship between intervals is still here.

*But if I start on a different note, like F for instance, while keeping the notes from the C major scale, I will not get the same intervals* Yes. This is called a mode. By the way, the scale you will get by starting of F is called the *Lydian scale* and can be described as a *major scale with an augmented fourth*. This will be detailled in another post.

## 3. Natural and relative minor

Major and natural minor scales are intrisincally related.

We can define a natural minor scale (note : this is typically called "minor scale") as the following set of intervals :

> major 2nd, minor 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, minor 6th, minor 7th

The *relative minor* scale of a certain major scale is the minor scale sharing its notes with the major scale chosen.

*Exercice :* Find the relative minor of C major. The relative minor of G major.
*Hint :* Look a third below the root.
