# Simple Music Part 5 : Harmony II

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, intervals, the natural minor scale.
## 1. Intervals. All of them... Most of them...

In Western music, the most common scheme for naming intervals gives two properties of the interval: the quality (perfect, major, minor, augmented, diminished) and the number (unison, second, third, etc.).

Let us build a table, counting the number of half-tone from a root note. Not all itnervals are given, only the most commonly used.

> Number of semitones | Number | Quality 
> 0                   | Unison | Perfect
> 1                   | Second | Minor
> 2                   | Second | Major
> 3                   | Second/Third | Augmented/Minor
> 4                   | Third | Major
> 5                   | Fourth | Perfect
> 6                   | Fourth/Fifth | Augmented/Diminished
> 7                   | Fifth | Perfect
> 8                   | Fifth/Sixth | Augmented/Minor
> 9                   | Sixth/Seventh | Major/ Diminished
> 10                  | Seventh | Minor (Dominant) 
> 11                  | Seventh | Major
> 12                  | Octave | Perfect

*Oh shoot ! That's too much to handle ><'* Again, don't worry.

## 2. Naming intervals in a scale

To use our newfound knowledge on intervals, let's use the C major scale.

> C-D-E-F-G-A-B

The intervals are, in order, and with respect to C :

> major 2nd, major 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, major 6th, major 7th

This set of intervals *defines* the major scale.

*Exercice :* Write the G major scale. Check that the relationship between the intervals is still here.

*But if I start on a different note, like F for instance, while keeping the notes from the C major scale, I will not get the same intervals* 

Yes. This is called a mode. By the way, the scale you will get by starting of F is called the *Lydian scale* and can be described as a *major scale with an augmented fourth*. This will be detailled in another post.

## 3. Natural and relative minor

Major and natural minor scales are intrisincally related.

We can define a natural minor scale (note : this is typically called "minor scale") as the following set of intervals :

> major 2nd, minor 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, minor 6th, minor 7th

The *relative minor* scale of a certain major scale is the minor scale sharing its notes with the major scale chosen.

*Exercice :* Find the relative minor of C major. The relative minor of G major.

*Hint :* Look a third below the root.

## 4. Consonnance and disonnance

Intervals can also be categorized in terms of consonnance and disonnance. 

Consonance is typically associated with sweetness and are generally considered pleasing; dissonance on the other hand is associated with harshness and tension.

There are 4 types  :

1. Perfect consonances:
    * unisons and octaves
    * perfect fourths
    * perfect fifths
2. Imperfect consonances:
    * major seconds and minor sevenths
    * major thirds and minor sixths
    * minor thirds and major sixths
3. Soft Dissonances 
    * major 2nds minor 7ths
    * Perfect fourth
4. Sharp disonnances
   * minor 2nds and major 7ths

*Err... Some things are repeating...* Yes. Consonances and disonnaces (the *sonance*) are relative to the music they are used in.

A tritone in medieval music is a blasphemy while it is almost consonnant in jazz.

A fourth is sometimes consonant, sometimes dissonant.

Is does not really help you, right ? Let's take a piece of paper.

*Exercice :* Play each of these intervals and give them a "absolute harshness score" (this is personal).

Then, compare each interval to its neighbours and give them a "relative harshness score".

As an example, let us take a major third. I would give it 7/10 as an absolute rating.

When compared to the intervals below and above, I would give it 6/10 for the augmented second to major third and 8/10 for the perfect fourth to the major third.

*Hint :* these scores should reflect how "satisfied" you feel after the forced move between these intervals.

Now, your turn !

There are no wrong or right answer though. And keep this sheet and note the evolution in your taste during your musical journey !

See you next time !

## 5. Seventh chords and ninth cloud

We remind you that triads are stacked thirds. But we can stack another third on top of that !

*Seriously ?* Yop. And it sounds even more interesting !

*Major seventh* : Let's take a C major triad (C-E-G). If we stack another third, with respect to the C major scale, we need to find the third of G, which is B.

We then have C-E-G-B. Play this on your instrument of choice.

For guitar players I suggest the following voicings :

```
E|------
B|-8--5-
G|-9--4-
D|-9--5-
A|----3-
E|-8----
```

Such chord can be notated C*maj7*, C*maj*, C*ma7*, CΔ (C triangle) or CΔ7.
