# Simple Music Part 5 : Harmony II

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, intervals and the natural minor scale.

## 1. Intervals. All of them...

In Western music, the most common scheme for naming intervals gives two properties of the interval: the quality (perfect, major, minor, augmented, diminished) and the number (unison, second, third, etc.).

Let us build a table, counting the number of half-tone from a root note. Not all itnervals are given, only the most commonly used.
> Number of semitones | Number | Quality 
> 0                   | Unison | Perfect
> 1                   | Second | Minor
> 2                   | Second | Major
> 3                   | Second/Third | Augmented/Minor
> 4                   | Third | Major
> 5                   | Fourth | Perfect
> 6                   | Fourth/Fifth | Augmented/Diminished
> 7                   | Fifth | Perfect
> 8                   | Fifth/Sixth | Augmented/Minor
> 9                   | Sixth/Seventh | Major/ Diminished
> 10                  | Seventh | Minor (Dominant) 
> 11                  | Seventh | Major
> 12                  | Octave | Perfect
