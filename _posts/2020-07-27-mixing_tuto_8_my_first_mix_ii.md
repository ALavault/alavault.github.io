# Simply Mixing Part 8 - My first mix II

Let us continue where we left off from part I...

We got drums, we need the rest.

## 1. All about that bass

### 1.1 Low end clarity

Two instruments will fight for the low end : the bass and the kick.

They cannot coexist *at the same level* : they will mask each other and create a mess.

So, you have to make a choice : which instrument will have the most low end extension ?

A quick checklist to have an idea :

* TODO
* TODO

In this song, I would go kick below the bass. In other words, the kick will be the king of low end.

### 1.2 The bass signal

Most basses are recorded *DI* (for *direct input*). This means the output of the bass is recorded raw, straight out of it, without going into an amp. Depending on the bass in might sounds great. Or not.

Here the recording is quite good.

### 1.3 Processing the bass

## 2. The guitars

The guitars have two functions in this song : rhythm and lead (solo). This means they should be treated differently, at least in terms of balance.

## 3. Noisy things with keys



That's all for today. We will see the vocals. Next time ;)
