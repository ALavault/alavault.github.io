# Simply Writing Part 1 : Basics

This post describes the basics of songwriting. Well, rather an introduction to the basics.

Requirements : an instrument (piano or guitar appreciated), knowledge from Simply Music 1-4 (reading music, basic harmony)

## 1. What makes a song a song ?

We can define a song as a *structured* composition whose parts are built of *harmony*, *rhythm* and *melody*.

### 1.1 Structure

A song, and in fact most of western music, is a structured composition.

A typical pop song structure is Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus which can be summed up as ABABCB.

Another typical structure in jazz is AABA : the *Rhythm Changes* follows this kind of structure..

*Storytime :* the song ABACAB, by Genesis, is named after the structure of the song.

*Exercise :* Listen to your favourite song, and try to write the general structure. When a part is repeated but with slight variations, add a number besides it (for instance A1-B-A2-C)

### 1.2 What's inside a part

A *part* can be defined by three elements : its *harmony*, its *rhythm* and its *melody*.

#### 1.2.1 Harmony

TODO

#### 1.2.2 Rhythm

TODO

#### 1.2.3 Melody

TODO

## 2. Writing our first song

As most of the pop songs are melody driven, the focus of this part is going to be melody.

In other words, you will have to find a melody, given an harmony and a general rhythm.

### 2.1 Our base

We are going to use a structure AABA. Each part (i.e. each letter) is going to be 4 bar long.

The harmony is here :

```
A : | C | Am | Dm | G(7)
B : | Am| Dm | Em | G(7)
```

This harmony is not exactly common in modern songs, but since the focus is to write a melody, we should not bother too much.

### 2.2 Making a melody

Listen to the backing track.

*What should I 'listen' to ?* Find where the changes occurs and have a feel of which notes feels good.

This requires to work on your *inner ear*. It may sounds like some esoteric stuff, but every musician has a voice inside their heads.

Also keep in mind this :

> The master has failed more times the disciple has tried.

You may not find the greatest melody right away. And it's fine.

But I find one, either record yourself singing it or write it down (it's even better to do both).

#### 2.2.1 Harmonic analysis

If you don't feel confident in your inner ear yet, let us do a bit of harmonic analysis !

*Part A* :

The triads are :

```
C major : C-E-G
A minor : A-C-E
D minor : D-F-A
G major (7): G-B-D-(F)
```

All these are chords from the C major scale : we can use this scale as our base set of notes.

*Chord tones and non-chord tones* : Depending on which chord is playing, certain notes are inside of the chord or not. Using chord tones is really consonant and allows for powerful resolutions. But having a melody with only consonance is...uninteresting. 

Another thing to keep in mind :

> Dissonance is emotion.

*Where should I put my dissonances ?* At the end of the part. But these dissonances should be resolved afterwards (not doing so can give an uneasy feeling, which can be desirable depending of the stylistic choice).

*And what about the other notes ?* You can of course use notes outside of the scale ! Try the Ab for instance over the C major chord.

*Exercise *: 
1. play an E in 1/4 notes over the A part. Hear/feel the difference when the E is a chord tone (on C and Am) and when its not (Dm and G)
2. play an F in 1/4 notes over the A part. Having the dissonance at the beginning while resolving on Dm feels somewhat odd.
3. play an Ab in 1/4 notes over the A part. Having only dissonances lead the phrase nowhere.
4. play the following phrase in 1/4 notes : G-F-E-F. 



#### 2.2.2 Musical phrases

Writing a melody is exactly like writing sentences. A melody is composed of *phrases*.

> If I write a sentence, I will write a build up, letting you think something interesting is at the end.

This is a sentence with "dissonances" but no resolution : it will feel bad, *unless* you are going for this (useful to end a song)

> I can write about lemon pie. Everybody likes lemon pie.

This is a "consonant" sentence : nothing interesting to read here. 

> I can also write a sentence without any kind of punctuation which is a pain to read of course and you should stop reading this as it is really painful to read.

This is a sentence with no rhythm : it can be a *stylistic* choice.

> Mary had a little lamb. One day the lamb disappeared. But Mary had a great kebab that day.

Here, we have a "good" sentence : consonance, dissonance, rhythm and resolution. But the resolution might not be the on expected.

Musical ideas can also be written has dialogues : it is known as *call and response*.

> Did you buy the groceries ?
> No, I didn't.
> At least, did you wash your hands ?
> Yes, I did.

While not being the most interesting dialogue. And you can have several voices as well (J.S. Bach was quite good at that).

*Exercise :* Watch a TV show or a movie you like, without the sound. Try to "sing" the dialogues.

*Remark :* TODO ?

#### 2.2.3 Your first phrase.

For the moment, we will try to write different phrases on a single chord : a C major.

TODO : backing track

*Remark:* dissonances are "stronger" when placed strong beats.

#### 2.2.4 Do It Yourself

Now, you should have the tools necessary to write your first song.

Go ahead and have fun !

Oh, and sing what you play is you are using an instrument : it will help build your inner ear as well as your pitch memory.
