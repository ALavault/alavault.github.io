# Simply Music Part 8 - Harmony III

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, diatonic modes and introduction to extended chords.

## 1. Building the diatonic modes

There are two ways of defining a mode : 
1. as the circular permutations of the note of a base scale
2. as a partial alteration of a base scale

The first way allows to quickly use the modes. But tends to make the learner forget the "sound" of the mode.

The other way is harder to remember but buy stressing the different alterations, tends to make the application more musical and less mechanical.

In this part, we are going to use both.

We are building the modes of the major scale today. There 7 notes in this scale, meaning we have to build 7 modes (from the first definition).

### 1.1 Ionian mode

If no permutation is apply (identity), we have the *ionian mode*.

Its notes are, in C : C-D-E-F-G-A-B

This is the major scale.

### 1.2 Dorian mode

By shifting by one, we begin on the D.

The notes are, in C : D-E-F-G-A-B-C

*Analysis:* this "scale" contains a minor third (F), we will compare it the natural minor scale.

If we had the D minor scale, the note would have been : D-E-F-G-A-Bb-C

But we have B instead of Bb : the minor 6th is raised.

We can then defined the *dorian mode* as a *minor scale with a raised/major 6th*

### 1.3 Phrygian mode

Same principle here.

The notes are, in C : E-F-G-A-B-C-D

*Analysis :* the scale is definitely minor (E-G).

The E natural minor scale is E-F#-G-A-B-C-D.

But we have F instead of F# : the 2nd is lowered.

We can then defined the *phrygian mode* as a *minor scale with a flat/minor 2nd*.

### 1.4 Lydian mode

The notes are, in C : F-G-A-B-C-D-E

*Analysis :* the scale is definitely major (F-A).

The F major scale is F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E

But we have B instead of Bb : the 4th is raised.

We can then defined the *lydian mode* as a *major scale with a sharp/augmented 4th*.

### 1.5 Mixolydian mode

The notes are, in C : G-A-B-C-D-E-F

*Analysis :* the scale is definitely major (G-B).

The G major scale is G-A-Bb-C-D-E-F#

But we have F instead of F# : the 7th is lowered.

We can then defined the *mixolydian mode* as a *major scale with a lowered/minor 7th*.

### 1.6 Aeolian mode

The notes are, in C : A-B-C-D-E-F-G-

*Analysis :* the scale is definitely minor (A-C).

It is exactly the A minor scale

We can then defined the *aeolian mode* as the *natural minor scale*.

### 1.7 Locrian mode

The notes are, in C : B-C-D-E-F-G-A

*Analysis :* the scale is definitely minor (B-D).

The B natural minor scale is B-C#-D-E-F#-G-A

But we have F instead of F# and C instead of C#: the 2nd is lowered as well as the 5th

We can then defined the *locrian mode* as a *minor scale with lowered 2nd and 5th*.



## 2. "Hearing" the modes

We are doing a little exercice to "hear" the differents modes by playing their implied harmony.

We are going to use a repeated bass note.

The idea is to play the root note of the mode (e.g. D in Dorian if in C major) and play all the differents triads over this bass note.



### 2.1 Example : the dorian mode

#### 2.1.1 Piano

To keep it simple, we will only deal with the modes derived from the key of C major i.e. white keys only.

We remind you the quality of the triads in the C major scale :

Note | C | D | E | F | G | A | B |
Quality |Major |Minor|Minor|Major|Major|Minor|Diminished

*Note :* the sign ùÑ¢ is the F-clef (or bass clef). Just like the G-clef, its double point indicates the position of the F.

On the piano, this F is located at the left of the middle C (it is the first one).

This part is usually played with the left hand.

*Exercice :* play it !


#### 2.1.2 Guitar

Contrary to the piano, it is harder to play only the white keys, since there are none.

And playing a pedal is harder too...

But fear not ! We can do it. And with only 4 strings !

```
G|-0---2---4---6---7---9---11--12-|
D|-2---4---5---7---9---11--12--14-|
A|-2---4---5---7---9---10--12--14-|
E|-0---0---0---0---0---0---0---0--|
   Em F#m  G   A   Bm  C#o D   Em

```

Note the finger patterns for the major, minor and diminished triad : it will be useful for the rest.

For the most advanturous, you can play the B and E strings open to get nice and intersting sound. 

*Remark :* The note above will not work with the locrian mode, unless you tune the B string to Bb.
*Remark :* Diminished chord are notated "o". 
### 2.2 Do it yourself !

Do the same with all the different diatonic modes, with your instrument of choice !

To be sure to hear the difference, play the major or minor scale (depending on the mode) and then play the modal triads.

Note somewhere some adjectives you would use to describe the modes.

*Example :* Ionian = happy, Aeolian = Sad, Lydian = Hopeful...

Use your own words. It will be a first step to your own musical voice ;)

### 2.3 Who use that anyway ?

Ok. A list :
* Ionian : whatever is described as major
* Dorian : Shine on Crazy Diamond, Oye como va, So what
* Phrygian : Symphony of Destruction
* Lydian : Flying in a Blue Dream, Electric Sunrise
* Mixolydian : Sweet Home Alabama, everything (?) by AC/DC
* Aeolian : whatever is considered written in minor
* Locrian : you won. Songs only in locrian are too unstable. But it is used as part (in Master of Puppets for instance).
