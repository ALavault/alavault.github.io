# Simply Music Part 6- The lead sheet format

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, reading a lead sheet.

## 1. The lead sheet format

The *lead sheet* is a form of musical notation that specifies the essentials elements of a (generally popular) song : the melody, the lyrics (if there are some) and the underlying harmony. 

The melody is written in classic music notation (check the previous Simply Music parts if you are not sure you can read), the lyrics are written as text below the staff and the harmony is specified with chord symbols above the said staff. 

## 2. Case study 1 : Autumn Leaves

### 2.1 The things around

There is a lot here. Let's break it down !

Two flats are notated near the G-clef : this means all the B and E are flatten unless they are notated otherwise.

If also means we are in either G minor or Bb major (rather G minor though).

"A" and "B" in squares : these shows the two big parts of the song : the A part and the B part. It is especially useful is the band wants to solo over a special structure (for instance an AABA structure). Or if someone is lost, a discrete call saying "x bars before A" for instance.

Above the staff, you have the symbols for the chords to play. If you see brackets, it means these chords are optional : they may be played by some but not by others.

*Remark :* the G7 on the last bar is non-required (up to your discretion) but the b5 in the A*mi7(b5)* at the first part of the B part is compulsory.

*Why there are some Ma sometimes ?* This means the degree notated afterwards is major e.g. Bb*maj7* is a Bb major chord with a major seventh.

But a F7 is a major chord with a minor seventh. C*mi7* means it is a minor chord with a minor seventh (it can get confusing...).

### 2.2 Playing a lead sheet

*The tempo* : indicated by "Medium Swing" means roughly between 120 and 150 BPM and should be played with a *swing* feel(listen to some interpretations). You can play with it with a straight feel is you want : these are just indications. I would personally go with 120

*Swing and straight ?* The straight feel is simply playing things as notated. The swing feel means you put the offbeats closer to the next beat.

An approximation is to play like a *shuffle* i.e. the 1 and 3 of a triplet (or the tri and let of the said triplet).

*Hint :* You should aim at giving a "heart-beat" feel if you want to "swing".

#### 2.2.1 The melody

*Exercice :* 
1. Play the melody and just the melody on your instrument of choice. Reading lead sheets from Real Books is a great sight-reading workout.
2. Once you feel confortable, play some music : be creative. Add some notes in the melody and experiment. You should still hear the main melodic idea though.
3. If an idea seems better than the other, write it down both pitch and rhythm.
4. Look for backing tracks on the internet to play over. But take the G minor ones.

*But it is written is G minor...* Well, yes and no. Originally, it was in written E minor. The most common interpretation are in G minor though. But you can transpose in to A minor if you want (or any other key for that matter).

Congratulations ! You are starting to become a musician !

#### 2.2.2 The harmony

*Exercice :* 
1. Play all the different chords and write down on separate sheet the voicings (i.e the way you chose to play them). Try not to move all over the place ;)
2. Work on these chords until you are satisfied with the results.
3. If you can, play these with the melody. It can get funny for the guitar players. It should be easy for those playing the piano though.

Congrats ! You have played your first lead sheet !

*Why should I care ? Tabs are here for a reason.* While tabs are greats, having either the fingering or the chords only is like having only a part of the answer.

In case you want your music played by others, you should write it down in some convenient way. And lead sheet are perfect for that.

It is also a great way to write drafts of your songs. (You can learn more about my method for writing music on the series called Simply Writing)




## 3. Case study 2 : Wayne Shorter - Footsteps

Now, you can play lead sheets on your own. But let just work on another one together, okay ?

Good.

There are 3 flats i.e. C minor or Eb major (it is C minor)

Footprints begins with a bass line (on the double bass) : it is going to be written with a F-clef.

*Exercice :* Play the bass line. Again, the piece should be played with a swing style.

It terms of structure, Footprints is a blues in C minor. This should give the feel of the original performance.

*There are two notes on the G-clef though...* Yep. If you look under the squared A, you can see another indication (trp ten). It means the high note is played by a trumpet and the lower note by a tenor saxophone (Wayne Shorter is a saxophonist by the way).

The chords are written in between the staves for convenience.

*What about this 5:3 thing ?* This means you should play 5 notes over three beats. It's a *polyrhythm*.

You can simplify it just like the following transcription :

*But the chords are different... And the notes too.* Keep in mind that these lead sheet are *transcriptions* i.e a human (or several humans) wrote down what he/they heard.

And you should do too : it is an amazing exercice. So...

*Exercice :*
* Compare both transcriptions to the original recording. Do you hear the transcription 1, the transcription 2 or something completely different ?
* Write what you hear (just the melody).

*It's hard...* If you can transcribe a jazz standard, you can transcribe almost anything. Which is useful when you want to learn the latest song of your favourite artist or because you didn't write down your songs...
