# Simply Mixing Part 3 - Tools

This post tries to describe the basics of mixing music. Today, a brief description of the most common tools.

## 1. DAW

### 1.1 Description

*DAW* is the acronym for *Digital Audio Workstation*. It can refer to a certain kind of software or the software and the matching hardware (sound card, computer, controllers...). We will call *DAW* only the software part.

The software DAW controls all related hardware components (sound-card, controllers) and provides a user interface with basic functionalities such as recording, editing, and playback.

Computer-based DAWs have extensive recording, editing, and playback capabilities especially when compared to tape. For instance, a DAW can provide an almost unlimited amount of tracks while also allowing to make use of huge sampled instruments. DAWs can also provide a wide variety of effects, such as reverb, to enhance or change the sounds themselves, again with almost limitless capabilities (especially compared to limited outboard gear).

### 1.2 What does it do ?

DAWs tend to have a standard layout that includes *transport controls* (play, rewind, record, etc.) and a mixer. A waveform display for the tracks is another common feature. This follows the traditional workflow of analog tape and console.

While some DAWs only support one track, most of them support operations on multiple tracks at once. Like an analog mixing console, each track typically has controls that allow the user to adjust the gain and stereo panning on each track. In a traditional recording studio additional outboard gear is physically plugged into the audio signal path (generally with a patch-bay) to add reverb, compression, etc. 
However, a DAW can also route in software or use *audio plug-ins* (for example, a VST plugin) to process the sound on a track : plugins are the software equivalent of outboard gear.

Commonly DAWs feature some form of *automation*, often performed through "envelopes". Envelopes are procedural line segment-based or curve-based interactive graphs. They can also be written by the user with a ad-hoc interface.
 The lines and curves of the automation graph are joined by or comprise adjustable points. By creating and adjusting multiple points along a waveform or control events, the user can specify parameters of the output over time (e.g., volume or pan).

Most DAWs have extensive MIDI capabilities, which useful to control outboard synthesizers or use DAW controllers.

### 1.3 The big names

Most of DAW are paid and proprietary.

To name a few : Pro Tools, Cubase, Fruity Loops, Studio One and Reaper.

While each DAW has its own idiosyncrasies, the main workflow of track + fader is common to everyone of them.

If you don't already have a DAW, I suggest you to get [Cakewalk](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk). It's free and is a fully functional DAW.

If you are an advocate of open-source project, you can try *Ardour* or *LMMS*.

## 2. Equalizer

In audio engineering, *equalization* is the use of filters to adjust the frequency response during recording or mixing. 

In a studio situation, equalization is used to improve or alter an instrument's sound or make certain instruments and sounds more prominent. For example, a recording engineer may use an equalizer to filter out unnecessary low-end or add brightness to a vocal recording.

An equalizer in in fact a set of filters. A quick typology :
* High-pass filter : let only the high frequencies through above a *cut-off frequency*.
* Low-pass filter : let only the low frequencies through below a *cut-off frequency*.
* Shelving filter : increases or decreases the frequency below (low shelf) or higher (high shelf) by a certain amount of *gain*.
* Bell filter : increases or decreases the frequencies around a chosen one with a certain breadth controlled by the *Q factor*.

## 3. Compressor

Compressors are dynamic processors : they are designed to reduce loud sounds and equivalently, increase quiet ones.

Compression (the fact of using a compressor) is often used in mixing to make performances more consistent in dynamic (i.e the range between loud and quiet) so that they "sit" in the mix of other instruments.

Vocal performances in rock music or pop music are compressed to improve clarity and to make them stand out from the surrounding instruments since this music is mostly vocal driven.

Compression can also be used on instrument sounds to shape their temporal characteristics. For instance, drums and cymbals tend to decay quickly, but a compressor can make the sound appear to have a more sustained tail : this is especially interesting on drum room recordings. Guitar sounds are often compressed to produce a fuller, more sustained sound. Please note that distortion on electric guitars produce a similar effect.

Most compressors, hardware or software, can also be used to reduce the volume of one audio source when another audio source reaches a certain level; this is called *side-chaining*. In EDM, side-chaining is often used on bass lines, controlled by the kick drum, to prevent the two from conflicting, and provide a pulsating, rhythmic dynamic to the sound. It is also used on synthesizers to give a "pulsating" feeling with respect to the kick drum.
