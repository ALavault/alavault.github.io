# Simply Writing Part 1 : Basics

This post describes the basics of songwriting. Well, rather an introduction to the basics.

Requirements : an instrument (piano or guitar appreciated), knowledge from Simply Music 1-4 (reading music, basic harmony)

## 1. What makes a song a song ?

We can define a song as a *structured* composition whose parts are built of *harmony*, *rhythm* and *melody*.

### 1.1 Structure

A song, and in fact most of western music, is a structured composition.

A typical pop song structure is Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus which can be summed up as ABABCB.

Another typical structure in jazz is AABA : the *Rhythm Changes* follows this kind of structure..

*Storytime :* the song ABACAB, by Genesis, is named after the strucure of the song.

*Exercice :* Listen to your favourite song, and try to write the general structure. When a part is repeated but with slight variations, add a number besides it (for instance A1-B-A2-C)

### 1.2 What's inside a part

A *part* can be defined by three elements : its *harmony*, its *rhythm* and its *melody*.
