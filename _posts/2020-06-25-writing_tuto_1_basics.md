# Simply Writing Part 1 : Basics

This post describes the basics of songwriting. Well, rather an introduction to the basics.

Requirements : an instrument (piano or guitar appreciated), knowledge from Simply Music 1-4 (reading music, basic harmony)

## 1. What makes a song a song ?

We can define a song as a *structured* composition whose parts are built of *harmony*, *rhythm* and *melody*.

### 1.1 Structure

A song, and in fact most of western music, is a structured composition.

A typical pop song structure is Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus which can be summed up as ABABCB.

Another typical structure in jazz is AABA : the *Rhythm Changes* follows this kind of structure..

*Storytime :* the song ABACAB, by Genesis, is named after the strucure of the song.

*Exercice :* Listen to your favourite song, and try to write the general structure. When a part is repeated but with slight variations, add a number besides it (for instance A1-B-A2-C)

### 1.2 What's inside a part

A *part* can be defined by three elements : its *harmony*, its *rhythm* and its *melody*.

#### 1.2.1 Harmony

#### 1.2.2 Rhythm

#### 1.2.3 Melody

## 2. Writing our first song

As most of the pop songs are melody driven, the focus of this part is going to be melody.

In other words, you will have to find a melody, given an harmony and a general rhythm.

### 2.1 Our base

We are going to use a structure AABA. Each part (i.e. each letter) is going to be 4 bar long.

The harmony is here :

```
A : | C | Am | Dm | G(7)
B : | Am| Dm | Em | G
```

This harmony is not exactly common in modern songs, but since the focus is to write a melody, we should not bother too much.
