# Simply Mixing Part 1 - Introduction

This post tries to describe the content of this series on mixing. Today, a quick introduction.

## 1. Digital world

This series will focus on mixing in the digital realm. To make it simple, using a computer and processing with the computer.

It is possible to mix using _analog gear_, but these tend to be more expensive and harder to setup.

Since this series aim at beginners, we will try to keep the investments to a minimum.

## 2. Artistic engineering

Mixing is just like any other engineering job : it requires _technical abilities_ to get it right and _creative abilities_ to make it awesome.

Technical abilities are easy to get : how filters work, how a compressor works, what are the loudness standard etc...

But to get everything to the next level, a good dose of creativity is required as well as a good understanding of music in general : nobody cares about the perfectly shaped tambourine if it is too loud. Tambourine should be banned anyway, just like bagpipes and trumpets.

Setting levels needs _taste_ and a _trained ear_. You do not need to have perfect pitch (it can help).
