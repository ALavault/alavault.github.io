# Simply Mixing Part 1 - Introduction

This post tries to describe the content of this series on mixing. Today, a quick introduction.

## 1. Digital world

This series will focus on mixing in the digital realm. To make it simple, using a computer and processing with the computer.

It is possible to mix using *analogue gear*, but these tend to be more expensive and harder to set-up. 

Since this series is aimed at beginners, we will try to keep the investments to a minimum.

## 2. Artistic engineering

Mixing is just like any other engineering job : it requires *technical abilities* to get it right and *creative abilities* to make it awesome.

Technical abilities are easy to get : how filters work, how a compressor works, what are the loudness standard etc...

But to get everything to the next level, a good dose of creativity is required as well as a good understanding of music in general : nobody cares about the perfectly shaped tambourine if it is too loud. Tambourine should be banned anyway, just like bagpipes and trumpets.

Setting levels needs *taste* and a *trained ear*. You do not need to have perfect pitch (it can help).

You should also be able at some point to mix (no pun intended) both your technique with an artistic view of the song.

## 3. What you will learn 

You will learn a few things. 

On the technical side :

- The basics of digital audio processing
- How to use the most common processing units
- Editing audio
- Basic psychoacoustics applied to mixing
- Preparing a mix

On the artistic side :

- Finding your "sound"
- Using common processors and effects to create interest
- Balancing instruments with respect to an artistic vision
- Building your creative process
