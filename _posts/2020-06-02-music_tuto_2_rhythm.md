# Simple music Part 2 : Rhythm

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, western-style rhythm.

## 1. Time. It needs time.

A broad definition of *rhythm* can be the organization in time of musical events.

In a more applicable way, when to play pitches.

Rhythm does not exists without a *pulse* : this what a metronome provides and it's the pulse that makes people head bang.

### 1.1 Divide and conquer

By dividing the pulse in subgroup of even size, we can create more interesting rhythm.

*Exercice :* 
- Listen to your favourite song and clap where you feel like it should happen. This is the pulse.
- Clap twice as fast. 
- Clap twice as slow. 
- Alternate clapping fast, normal and slow.

With this exercice, we have seen binary division of time. But it is perfectly fine to divide the pulse in 3, 5 or 7 sub-pulses to create even more intricate results.

Examples of ternary subdivision are easily found with most blues songs (I would suggest to do the exercice on "Still Got The Blues" by Gary Moore, as it is slow and subdivision are heavily marked).

### 1.2 The sound of silence

A non negligible part of rhythm is silence. Let us modify the previous exercice.

*Exercice :* 
- Listen to your favourite song and sing a note ("La") where the pulse is. Pitch does not matter here.
- Sing twice as fast. ("LaLaLaLa")
- Sing twice as slow and hold the note ("Laaaaaa")
- Clap twice as slow but don't hold the note ("La....La....")
- Alternate the duration. If your song choice has a clear melody, sing the rhythm of the melody.

## 2. Reading and writing rhythm.

### 2.1 What does rhythm look like ?

![drum-pattern](/assets/img/posts/Characteristic_rock_drum_pattern_rimshot.png){:class="img-responsive"}

This is a example of the most simple drum beat in existence.

From left to right :
* double vertical bar : indicates this a drum transcription. We will see how pitches are written later.
* 4/4 : this is the time signature. It defines the number of pulses (4) and the value of a subdivision (here, a 1/4 note)

*But we haven't seen it yet...*
Please, bear with me. It will come soon enough.

* Things. Circles and crosses.
* double point + double bar : indicates the end of the musical document (double bar) and a repeat (double point). This does not really matter right now.

### 2.2 How to understand that...

1/4 notes are notated ♩. 1/8 notes are notated ♪. Two 1/8 notes are worth a 1/4 notes i.e. ♫ = ♩ in terms of total duration.

Given this remark, we have on the line above of the example 8 crosses. These are 8 1/8th notes.

*Exercice :* Let us count this part.
* Clap at somewhat slow tempo (take your heartbeat as a reference). Clap your hands on the pulse you have chosen.
These are 1/4th notes.
* Sing the 1/8th notes. It should go as follows :

```
    -1   -    -2        -3        -4        -1
    -Clap-    -Clap-    -Clap-    -Clap-    -Clap
    -La  -La  -La  -La  -La  -La  -La  -La  -La
```

(There is the same amount of time between two dashes "-")

* Now, do the same with the line on the middle (1/4 note on beats 2 and 4)
* Now do the same with the last line. (1/4 note on beat 1 and 2 1/8 note on beat 3)

### 2.3 Going further path/to/img2.png,path/to/img3.png

#### 2.3.1 Deriving from the 1/4
We can derive a whole lot of different division. 
* the 1/16 note : 4 1/16 make a 1/4, 2/16 make a 1/8
* the 1/2 : one 1/2 makes is 2 1/4 long
* the whole :  one is 4 1/4 long.

It can go up to 1/64 and 4 whole. But these tend to be extremes.

#### Dotted values

Adding a dot next to a note indicates its duration is increased by half of its original (or +50% longer)

For a quarter note, it is notated ♩. : in this case, the note is 1/4 + 50% * 1/4 = 3/8 i.e. it is worth 3 1/8 notes.

*Exercice : * Derive the values of dotted notes for the 1/8th and 1/2 notes.

#### 2.3.2 Non-binary subdivisions

As stated above, we can of course create non binary subdivisions. The most common is a ternary subdivision.

*Exercice : the blues shuffle*
* Clap your hands. This is the pulse for the exercice (don't go too fast).
* Say the word "tri-po-let" between each pulse/clap (with tri on the pulse/clap).
It should go like :
```
    -Clap-    -     -Clap-    -
    -Tri -Po  - Let -Tri -Po  - Let 
```
The rhythm should feel like a waltz.
* Now, only say the Tri and Let part of the word. You should get a feeling of unevenness, like a rolling egg. This is the shuffle.

## 3. Transcription exercices

### 3.1 Rock You Like A Hurricane - Intro
This song is in 4/4. The main riff is 2 bars long and is composed on 1/8 notes only.

You are provided with the following grid. Copy it somewhere and complete it
```
-1 -& -2 -& -3 -& -4 -& -1 -& -2 -& -3 -& -4 -& 
-ta-ta-ta-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  
```

The three first hits are already present. Complete the chart.
*Hint* : the drums are hitting on the beats 2 and 4.

### Dave Brubeck - Unsquare Dance

Listen to Dave Brubeck - Unsquare Dance. Try clapping with the song.

As the name suggest, the song has an "unsquare" rhythm. Matter of fact, a bar has 7 pulses.

Count it out loud (1,2,3,4,5,6,7). 

*Hint*: The hand claps are on beats 2,4,6 and 7.


### Jeff Berlin - Bach

Knowing that the drums are playing on beat 1,2,3 & 4, what is the subdivision played by the band ?

This piece by Jeff Berlin is a transcription of the Prelude in C minor, BWV 847 with an added bass solo.

If you feel confident, you can transcribe the different solos. Good luck with that...

### Primus - My Name Is Mud

Transcribe the intro part, rhythmically. 

*Hint* : the snare does not land always on the beat. The main subdivision is in 1/8 notes though.

### Joe Satriani - Always With Me, Always With You

The time signature of this song should remind you of a common dance : which one ?

On a similar chart as above, note when the following instruments play : shaker, guitar, bass,
