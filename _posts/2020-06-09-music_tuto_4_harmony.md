# Simple Music Part 4 : Harmony I

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, basic chords and harmony on the major scale.

## 1. Scalability or scale hability ?

We are going to see our first scale : the C major scale !

In terms of notes, the C major scale is, in order : 

>C-D-E-F-G-A-B


If you want to play it on a piano, you just have to play the white keys, starting from the C.

*Are there major scale starting on G for instance ?* Yes there is. In fact, a major scale is a predefined set of *intervals*.

The intervals composing a major scale are, in order :

> Tone-Tone-1/2 Tone-Tone-Tone-Tone-1/2 Tone

Let us check that :

* From C to D : whole tone
* From D to E : whole
* From E to F : half
* From F to G : whole
* From G to A : whole
* From A to B : whole
* From B to C : half

*Exercice :* From this intervalic formula, derive the G major and F major scale
*Hint:* the G major is written with one sharp (F♯) and F major is written with one flat (B♭). 

## 2. Meeting with the Triads

Nothing related to the mafia hopefully : in music, a triad is a set of three notes that can be stacked vertically in thirds.

*In... thirds ?* Yes, it is the name of an interval, which can be major or minor. But we don't care (yet).

To create a triad on the major scale, we will have to count.

Example : the triad derived from C, in the C major scale.

Let us give a number to each note :

>1|2|3|4|5|6|7
>C|D|E|F|G|A|B

A triad is based on the notes 1,3 and 5. They are called the *root*, the *third* and the *fifth* respsectively, with respect to C.

The triad derived from C is then 1-3-5 i.e. C-E-G.

*Exercice :* With the same kind of process, derive the triads from F, G and A (in the C major scale).

## 3. Checking the ID of A minor to C if it major

Bad puns aside, you may have heard of major and minor chords. If you didn't, it is not really a big deal.

A major triad is defined as a triad whose *third* is major and its *fifth* is *perfect*.

*I have rien compris...* It's fine. Don't worry.

The definition of the *major third* is the note 2 whole tones above the chosen root note e.g. C to E is a major third, and so is F to A.

A *perfect fifth* 3.5 whole tones (3 whole tones and a half) above the chosen root note e.g. C to G is a perfect fifth, so is F to C.

*But the triad derived from A is A-C-E : it's not a major third.* Good point : there is only 1 tone and a half. This interval is called a *minor third* (from A to C). It is one half-step lower than a major third.

*Exercice :* 
* Find all the minor thirds in the C major scale (there are 4).
* Derive the triads from these minor thirds. One chord is not like the other : spell it.

*Houston, we have a problem... I can't get a perfect fifth from the B minor triad* Yep. The triad you end up with is B-D-F, and if you count the number of tone between B and F, you get 3 :this is the infamous tritone. 

*So it is a minor fifth ?* No. In this case, it is called a *diminished fifth*. The triad you have with B-D-F is called a *diminished triad*.

## 4. Counting chords

There are 7 triads derived from the C major scale :
* 3 are major : C, F and G
* 3 are minor : D, E, and A
* 1 is diminished : B

*Does this mean the minor scale is built in the same ?* Yes. But we will see that later !

## 5. Playing chords

### 5.1 Piano

A friendly reminder :

![oiano](/assets/img/posts/piano-keyboard_diagram_2.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

*Exercice:* 
* Play the C major scale, ascending and descending
* Play the major or minor thirds (when they happen), ascending and descending. You can do this with one or both hands.
* Play the fifth, perfect or diminished.
* Play the full triads !

There are two triads in Happy Birthday : C and F. Try to play the chords with your left hand (lower than middle C) and the melody !

### 5.2 Guitar

Normal problem with the guitar, you can play the note at several places. And playing triads "stacked" can force unwanted finger streching.

Because of this we are going to play *spread triads* : instead of playing C-E-G, we will play C-G-E

We give two fingering for each type of triad :

*C major : C-E-G*
```
    B|-5-        G|-9-- 
    G|---    OR  D|----
    D|-5-        A|-10-
    A|-3-        E|-8--

```

*C minor : C-E♭-G*
```
    B|-4-        G|-8-- 
    G|---    OR  D|----
    D|-5-        A|-10-
    A|-3-        E|-8--

```

*C diminished : C-E♭-G♭*
```
    B|-4-        G|-8-- 
    G|---    OR  D|----
    D|-4-        A|-9-
    A|-3-        E|-8--

```

I have time, I may write an arrangement for guitar.
