# Simple music Part 3 : Reading music

This post tries to describe the basics of music. Today, reading music.

## Case study : Happy Birthday

![happy-birthday](/assets/img/posts/Happy_Birthday.png){:class="img-responsive"}


### Ask the staff

To represents pitches, notes are placed on a *staff* (or stave in British English). The staff is defined as a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitch.

It is possible to extend the staff by putting bar on the rounded part of the note, indicating additional lines or spaces.

### Clef des champs

The weird sign on the left (𝄞) is called a G-clef or a treble clef. It gives a reference to read pitches on the staff. The G-clef indicates where the G is located on the staff.

*Exercice :* Let us find where the G is located on the "Happy Birthday" example. Start at the bottom of the clef and follows the trace. You shoud end up on the second line from the bottom.

There are two G : find them !

### Time signature

Here, the time signature is 3/4 i.e. 3 pulses per bar.

*Wait a minute... The first bar is only one pulse long (because I know my dotted values)*.

Yes. This is called an *anacrusis*. These notes are a kind of introduction to the main melody, to launch the song. 

Because the first bar is incomplete, the first bar is in fact the second one.

### Silences

We have seen last the duration value of notes, but we can do exactly the same with silences.

We have the following symbol in the piece : "𝄾 ". It is a 1/8 note rest. We can think of it as the silent counterpart of the 1/8th note.

For the quarter note, it is notated 𝄽  . For the 1/2, 𝄼   and for the whole 𝄻  . For 1/16th, 𝄿 .

### Reading notes

We know, because of the clef that notes located on the 2nd line from the bottom are G.

But what about the rest ?

Well, first, please know that you will have to know your note names. Please refer to part 1 in case you are not confident. Keep in mind that Fa is F.

Let us go to bar 3 ("birth-day to") and let's find the notes in here.

We can already see a note is on the 2nd line from the bottom : it is a G ! Two to go.

The first note on the bar is a D.

In other word, the lower the note on the staff, the lower it is in pitch. And vice-versa for the higher pitches.

*But why ?* We know that the note on the 2nd line from the bottom is a G. 
If you go in between the 1st and the second line we have the note below the G : a F.
If you go on the line below this space, we have an E. And if we go into the virtual space below we have a D.

*So the thing with the bar in the middle is a C ?* Yes. Since there are no actual line, the note contains one to show it is on a virtual line.

While it is not present in our case study, the same kind of notation exists if a note becomes too high.

*Exercice :* We found that the lowest note that can be written without virtual lines is a D. Find the highest possible note.

*Great, but there are twelve tones per octave. I count only 7...* Yep. The staff is made in such a way that without alterations we have the "natural" notes (Do, Ré, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si).

To access all 12 tones, we use alterations. Look at bar 6 : the B are altered (they are flattened). But a natural B (i.e. without alteration) is going to be placed at the same place.

If we had a La♯ (enharmonic to Si♭), it would have been written on the space below, with the ♯ sign.

*Exercice :* Note all the note name of the piece (without consideration for rhythm).

You should end up with (the division are the same as the bars) :

> C-C|D-C-F|E-C-C|D-C-G|F-C-C|C-A-F|E-D-B♭-B♭|A-F-G|F

### Other things

We have a few other things written.

*Allegro* : this is a tempo indication. It roughly means the tempo (i.e. the pulse) should be between 110 and 160 beats per minute.
*Traditionnal* : this indicates what genre of music it is.
*F & C* : this indicates what chords should be played. We will see that during an upcoming part on harmony and chords ;)

## Playing "Happy Birthday"

### On the piano

To play Happy Birthday, we only need one octave, from C to C.

![oiano](/assets/img/posts/piano-keyboard_diagram_2.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We will need to find the *middle C* : it correspond to the lowest note (the lowest C) on Happy Birthday.

![oiano](/assets/img/posts/middle-c-on-piano-keyboard.png){:class="img-responsive"}

*I can play where I want !* No you can't. Using the G-clef indicates where the G is located on the staff, but it also implies a certain pitch as well. The treble clef implies the G4 (since the middle C is C4).

Anyway, now that you have your middle C, go back to the first picture. The middle C will be equivalent to the left-most C.

From that, find the G.

Then, play all the notes used in Happy Birthday : C-D-E-F-G-A-B♭-C. Do it ascending and descending.

After that, work on the rhythm : play the rhythm against a metronome/pulse generator.

Once the rhythm is mastered, add the notes, until perfect !

### On the guitar

First, the problem : the middle C on the piano does not correspond to the "middle C" on the guitar. Matter of fact, it is one octave lower. It means if you play the same piece on a piano and on a guitar, it would sound one octave lower on the guitar.

Anyway, let us work on that !

Assuming you are using the E standard tuning, there are two "middle C" : 3rd fret on the 5th string (i.e. A string) and 8th fret on the 6th string (i.e. the low E string).

Here are the notes used in Happy Birthday, as a tab

```
       C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C            C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
    G|-----------2-3-5-        D|-----------7-8-10- 
    D|-----2-3-5-------  OR    A|-----7-8-10-------
    A|-3-5-------------        E|-8-10-------------
```

If you want to play at the same pitch as the piano, you will have to transpose an octave higher. Here are the notes in two positions :

```
       C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C            C-D- E-F- G-A- B- C
    E|-----------5-6-8-        B|-------------10-11-13- 
    B|-----5-6-8-------  OR    G|------9-10-12-------
    G|-5-7-------------        D|-10-12-------------
```

Once you found the notes, you can add the rhythm. And then you are good to go.
