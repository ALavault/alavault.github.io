Hello everyone !

![piano](/assets/img/posts/placeholder.png){:class="rounded"}

I am Antoine Lavault, a research engineer in AI and a PhD student at IRCAM.

But I also like music, especially sound engineering and producing. And I want you to follow along with me !


I have a few series on music mostly aimed at beginners or simply curious people :

* Simply Music : learn the basics to read and play music [Ongoing]
* Simply Guitar : learn the basics of guitar, in a non-classical way [Ongoing]
* Simply Writing : write songs with interesting melodies and creative harmony [Ongoing]
* Simply Producing : learn how to record, mix and master your songs for release [Soon]
