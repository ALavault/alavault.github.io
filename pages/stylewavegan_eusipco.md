# StyleWaveGAN: Style-based synthesis of drum sounds using generative adversarial networks for higher audio quality

We introduce StyleWaveGAN, a style-based drum sound generator that is a variation of StyleGAN, a state-of-the-art image generator. By conditioning StyleWaveGAN on the type of drum, we are able to synthesize waveforms
faster than real-time on a GPU directly in CD quality up to a duration of 1.5s while retaining some control over the generation. We also introduce an alternative to the progressive growing of GANs and experimented on the effect
of dataset balancing for generative tasks. The experiments are carried out on an augmented subset of a publicly available dataset comprised of different drums and cymbals. We evaluate against two recent drum generators,
WaveGAN and NeuroDrum, demonstrating significantly improved generation quality (measured with the Frechet Audio Distance) as well as perceptive testing.
